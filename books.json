  "summary": "<p>This Audible Exclusive production revisits one of Dickens' popular novels: <i>A Tale of Two Cities<\/i>. In Dickens' driving narrative we see many themes that permeate life today as well as characters who provide a window into the past. This, coupled with Simon Callow's expert narration, is a treat for those new to Dickens and lifelong fans alike. Featuring an exclusive introduction written by Callow, whose passion for Dickens shines through. <\/p> <p>This release marks the start of the Dickens Collection, an exclusive series of unmissable performances available throughout 2018. <\/p> <p><b>About the book<\/b> <\/p> <p><i>'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.'<\/i> <\/p> <p>So begins Charles Dickens' most famous historical drama: a gripping tale of war, social injustice and the choice between darkness and light. After being unjustly imprisoned for 18 years, French doctor Manette is released from the Bastille jail in Paris and embarks upon a journey to London in the hope of finding the daughter he never met. Young Lucie Manette is a pretty and dutiful girl who soon attracts the attention of two very different gentlemen. Now reunited with the father she believed to be dead, happiness appears to be within reach. But as they are all drawn back to the bloodstained streets of Paris, misery and the threat of La Guillotine loom once again. <\/p> <p>In Callow's introduction, we discover how Dickens' own volatile personal circumstances of the time are mirrored in <i>A Tale of Two Cities<\/i>. He tells of Dickens' personal feuds and explains why this novel sees Dickens at his most theatrical. <\/p> <p><b>About the author<\/b> <\/p> <p>With his father incarcerated, Charles Dickens had to abandon his studies at a young age and set to work in a factory so as to support himself. Despite his short-lived education, Dickens went on to write 15 novels, various articles, novellas and short stories. He lectured and led campaigns for children's rights and education and arguably became the ultimate self-made man. Dickens had strong values, and they pervade <i>A Tale of Two Cities<\/i>, which can be seen as not only an inspirational text but one which will continue to stand the test of time. <\/p> <p><b>About the narrator<\/b> <\/p> <p>Simon Callow is a multi-award-winning actor, writer and theatre director. He is best known for his performances in <i>Amadeus<\/i>, <i>Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls<\/i> and <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral<\/i>. Simon has vast stage experience and clearly loves what he does. His fervour began at a young age working as box office staff, and it wasn't long before he made the transition from behind the scenes to centre stage - never looking back. <\/p> <p>Callow is also known for his literary talents and has published various biographies including those of Oscar Wilde, Charles Laughton and Orson Welles. He has narrated over 20 audiobooks and brings his wealth of experience and characteristic charm to this exciting performance.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p> Few events have had a more profound impact on the social and cultural upheavals of the Sixties than the psychedelic revolution spawned by the spread of LSD. This audiobook for the first time tells the full and astounding story - part of it hidden till now in secret Government files - of the role the mind-altering drug played in our recent turbulent history and the continuing influence it has on our time. And what a story it is, beginning with LSD\u2019s discovery in 1943 as the most potent drug known to science until it spilled into public view some 20 years later to set the stage for one of the great ideological wars of the decade. In the intervening years the CIA had launched a massive covert research program in the hope that LSD would serve as an espionage weapon, psychiatric pioneers came to believe that acid would shed light on the perplexing problems of mental illness, and a new generation of writers and artists had given birth to the LSD sub-culture. <i>Acid Dreams<\/i> is a complete social history of the psychedelic counter-culture that burst into full view in the Sixties. With new information obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the authors reveal how the CIA became obsessed with LSD during the Cold War, fearing the Soviets had designs on it as well. What follows is one of the more bizarre episodes in the covert history of U.S. intelligence as the search for a \"truth drug\u201d began to resemble a James Bond scenario in which agents spied on drug-addicted prostitutes through two-way mirrors and countless unwitting citizens received acid with sometimes tragic results. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>John Brown is a common name, but the John Brown who masterminded the failed raid at Harpers Ferry was anything but common. His failed efforts have left an imprint upon our history, and his story still swirls in controversy. Was he a madman who felt his violent solution to slavery was ordained by Providence or a heroic freedom fighter who tried to liberate the downtrodden slave? These polar opposite characterizations of the violent abolitionist have captivated Americans.<\/p> <p>When Brown's characteristics are compared to the definition of terrorism as set forth by scholars of terrorism, he fits the profile. Nevertheless, today Brown is a martyred hero who gave his life attempting to terminate the evil institution of human bondage. Brown's violent method of using terrorism to accomplish this is downplayed or ignored, despite being labeled by historians as America's first terrorist. The modern view of Brown has unintentionally made him a \"good terrorist,\" despite the repugnance of terrorism that makes the thought of a benevolent or good terrorist an oxymoron.<\/p> <p>This new biography covers Brown's background and the context to his decision to carry out the raid, a detailed narrative of the raid and its consequences for both those involved and America; and an exploration of the changing characterization of Brown since his death.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Today in the United States, there are more than 500 federally recognized Indigenous nations comprising nearly three million people, descendants of the 15 million Native people who once inhabited this land. The centuries-long genocidal program of the US settler-colonial regimen has largely been omitted from history. Dunbar-Ortiz adroitly challenges the founding myth of the United States and shows how policy against the Indigenous peoples was colonialist and designed to seize the territories of the original inhabitants, displacing or eliminating them. And as Dunbar-Ortiz reveals, this policy was praised in popular culture, through writers like James Fenimore Cooper and Walt Whitman, and in the highest offices of government and the military. Spanning more than 400 years, this classic bottom-up peoples' history radically reframes US history and explodes the silences that have haunted our national narrative.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Bernie Sanders' 2016 candidacy expanded the scope of political possibility in the United States, putting socialism and class politics back on the map. His radical campaign - not just for the Democratic presidential candidacy but against \"the billionaire class\" - helped catalyze other transformative left-wing politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to seek and win office, just as he inspired teachers from West Virginia to Los Angeles to win hard-fought, historic strike campaigns. Sanders has, in short, helped cohere a new movement in American politics.<\/p> <p>But even when coverage of Sanders takes stock of the sea change he has affected in American politics, it all too often fails to grasp what's unique about his approach. The senior senator from Vermont has demanded new policies and political approaches in this country - though he has also hinted at more, calling repeatedly for a \"political revolution\", something that he says would involve \"millions of Americans\" getting involved in politics not just at the ballot box, but in their workplaces and neighborhoods, too.<\/p> <p>In this book, Micah Uetricht and Meagan Day go beyond a simple balance sheet of Democratic Party politics. In a clear and effective style, they detail what we need to do to get beyond the Sanders campaign or presidency to transform the US from top to bottom.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>One of the most feared Chicago mobsters, Sam Giancana, clawed his way to the top of the Mafia hierarchy by starting as a hit man for Al Capone. He was known as one of the best vehicle escape artists, a tenacious business man, and a ruthless killer. He partied with major stars such as Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe and did business with agents ranging from the CIA to the Vatican to the shah of Iran. When politician Joe Kennedy gave Giancana the chance to use mob muscle to get his son John elected, Giancana jumped at the task. But the Kennedy brothers double-crossed him, waging full-out war on organized crime throughout the United States. And Giancana went after them.  <\/p> <p>Written with suspense and conviction, we learn about how the CIA asked Giancana to assassinate Fidel Castro. The book includes Giancana's testimony about the truth of his involvement in the deaths of Monroe and others. Chuck Giancana, Sam's brother, contributes a unique perspective of the mob's relationship with the Bay of Pigs and many other pivotal events of the '60s and beyond. <i>Double Cross<\/i> is an eye-opening account of the interworking of the government and the mob and how this relationship has impacted American history.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In the United States today, one in every 31 adults is under some form of penal control, including one in 11 African American men. How did the \"land of the free\" become the home of the world's largest prison system? Challenging the belief that America's prison problem originated with the Reagan administration's War on Drugs, Elizabeth Hinton traces the rise of mass incarceration to an ironic source: the social welfare programs of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society at the height of the civil rights era. <\/p> <p>Johnson's War on Poverty policies sought to foster equality and economic opportunity. But these initiatives were also rooted in widely shared assumptions about African Americans' role in urban disorder, which prompted Johnson to call for a simultaneous War on Crime. The 1965 Law Enforcement Assistance Act empowered the national government to take a direct role in militarizing local police. Federal anticrime funding soon incentivized social service providers to ally with police departments, courts, and prisons. Under Richard Nixon and his successors, welfare programs fell by the wayside while investment in policing and punishment expanded. <\/p>",

Angrily challenging the fashionable theories of anthropocenes, who contend that humans can survive alone in an Edenic bubble engineered for their own survival, Wilson documents that the biosphere does not belong to us. Yet, refusing to believe that our extinction is, as so many fear, predetermined, Wilson has written <i>Half-Earth<\/i> as a cri de coeur, proposing that the only solution to our impending \"sixth extinction\" is to increase the area of natural reserves to half the surface of the Earth. <\/p> <p>Suffused with a profound Darwinian understanding of our planet's fragility, <i>Half-Earth<\/i> is a transformative work that reverberates with an urgency like few other books. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>\"A brilliant, remarkably concise explanation of the danger that U.S and NATO military involvement in Ukraine has created. Needs to be read and pondered by every citizen capable of thinking rationally and responsibly about American and European security.\" (Jack F. Matlock, Jr., U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, 1987-1991)<\/p> <p>According to the mainstream Western narrative, Vladimir Putin is an insatiable, Hitler-like expansionist who invaded Ukraine in an unprovoked land grab. That story is incorrect. In reality, the United States and NATO bear much of the responsibility for the Ukraine crisis. Through a series of misguided policies, Washington and its European allies placed Russia in an untenable situation for which war seemed, to Mr. Putin and his military staff, the only workable solution. In How the West Brought War to Ukraine, author Benjamin Abelow lays out the relevant history and explains how the West needlessly produced conflict, subjecting its own citizens and the rest of the world to the risk of nuclear war.<\/p> <p>\"An invaluable primer on the trends and events that produced the escalating warfare in Ukraine. Without understanding the history documented in this book, there will be no de-escalation of the US-Russian confrontation on Europe's eastern borders.\" (Chas Freeman, previously Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs)<\/p> <p>\"Abelow makes a clear and compelling case that the United States and its NATO allies\u2014not Vladimir Putin\u2014are the principal culprits.\" (John J. Mearsheimer, the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago)<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>A timely examination by a leading scientist of the physical, psychological, and moral effects of inequality. <\/p> <p>Today's inequality is on a scale that none of us has seen in our lifetimes, yet this disparity between rich and poor has ramifications that extend far beyond mere financial means. In <i>The Broken Ladder<\/i>, psychologist Keith Payne examines how inequality divides us not just economically, but also has profound consequences for how we think, how our cardiovascular systems respond to stress, how our immune systems function, and how we view moral ideas such as justice and fairness. <\/p> <p>Experiments in psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics have not only revealed important new insights on how inequality changes people in predictable ways, but have also provided a corrective to our flawed way of viewing poverty as the result of individual character failings. Among modern developed societies, economic inequality is not primarily about money, but rather about relative status: where we stand in relation to other people. Regardless of their average income, countries or states with greater levels of income inequality have much higher rates of all the social problems we associate with poverty, including lower average life expectancies, serious health issues, mental illness, and crime. <\/p> <p><i>The Broken Ladder<\/i> explores such issues as why women in poor societies often have more children, and have them younger; why there is little trust among the working class that investing for the future will pay off; why people's perception of their relative social status affects their political beliefs, and why growing inequality leads to greater political divisions; how poverty raises stress levels in the same way as a physical threat; inequality in the workplace and how it affects performance; why unequal societies become more religious; and finally offers measures people can take to lessen the harm done by inequality in their own lives and the lives of their children. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>The author of three books on CIA operations, Douglas Valentine began his research into the agency's activities when CIA director William Colby gave him free access to interview agency officials who had been involved in various aspects of the Phoenix program in South Vietnam. It was a permission Colby was to regret. The CIA would eventually rescind it and made every effort to impede publication of <i>The Phoenix Program<\/i>, which documented an elaborate system of population surveillance, control, entrapment, imprisonment, torture, and assassination in Vietnam. <\/p> <p>While researching <i>Phoenix<\/i>, Valentine learned that the CIA allowed opium and heroin to flow from its secret bases in Laos to generals and politicians on its payroll in South Vietnam. His investigations into this illegal activity focused on the CIA's relationship with the federal agencies mandated by Congress to stop illegal drugs from entering the United States. Based on interviews with senior officials, Valentine wrote two subsequent books, <i>The Strength of the Wolf<\/i> and <i>The Strength of the Pack<\/i>, showing how the CIA infiltrated federal drug enforcement agencies and commandeered their executive management, intelligence, and foreign operations staffs in order to ensure the unimpeded flow of drugs to traffickers and foreign officials in its employ. <\/p> <p>Ultimately, portions of his research materials were archived at the National Security Archive, Texas Tech University's Vietnam Center, and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. <\/p> <p>This book includes excerpts from the aforementioned titles, along with subsequent articles and transcripts of interviews on a range of current topics, with a view to shedding light on the systemic dimensions of the CIA's ongoing illegal and extralegal activities. These articles and interviews illustrate how the agency's activities impact social and political movements abroad and at home. <\/p> <p>A common theme is the CIA's ability to deceive and propagandize the American public through its impenetrable, government-sanctioned shield of official secrecy and plausible deniability. <\/p> <p>Though investigated by the Church Committee in 1975, CIA praxis then continues to inform CIA praxis today. Valentine tracks the agency's steady expansion into practices targeting the last population to be subjected to the exigencies of the American empire: the American people themselves. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Society is broken. We can design our way to a better one. <\/p> <p>In our interconnected world, self-interest and social interest are rapidly becoming indistinguishable. If current negative trajectories remain, including growing climate destabilization, biodiversity loss, and economic inequality, an impending future of ecological collapse and societal destabilization will make \"personal success\" virtually meaningless. Yet our broken social system incentivizes behavior that will only make our problems worse. If true human rights progress is to be achieved today, it is time we dig deeper - rethinking the very foundation of our social system. <\/p> <p>In this engaging, important work, Peter Joseph, founder of the world's largest grassroots social movement - the Zeitgeist Movement - draws from economics, history, philosophy, and modern public-health research to present a bold case for rethinking activism in the 21st century. <\/p> <p>Arguing against the long-standing narrative of universal scarcity and other pervasive myths that defend the current state of affairs, <i>The New Human Rights Movement<\/i> illuminates the structural causes of poverty, social oppression, and the ongoing degradation of public health, and it ultimately presents the case for an updated economic approach. Joseph explores the potential of this grand shift and how we can design our way to a world where the human family has become truly sustainable. <\/p> <p><i>The New Human Rights Movement<\/i> reveals the critical importance of a unified activism working to overcome the inherent injustice of our system. This book warns against what is in store if we continue to ignore the flaws of our socioeconomic approach, while also revealing the bright and expansive future possible if we succeed. Will you join the movement? <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In December 1937, in the capital of China, one of the most brutal massacres in the long annals of wartime barbarity occurred. The Japanese army swept into the ancient city of Nanking and within weeks not only looted and burned the defenseless city but systematically raped, tortured and murdered more than 300,000 Chinese civilians. Amazingly, the story of this atrocity- one of the worst in world history- continues to be denied by the Japanese government.  <\/p> <p><i>The Rape of Nanking<\/i> tells the story from three perspectives: that of the Japanese soldiers who performed it; of the Chinese civilians who endured it; and finally of a group of Europeans and Americans who refused to abandon the city and were able to create a safety zone that saved almost 300,000 Chinese. It was Iris Chang who discovered the diaries of the German leader of this rescue effort, John Rabe, whom she calls the \"Oskar Schindler of China.\" A loyal supporter of Adolf Hitler, but far from the terror planned in his Nazi-controlled homeland, he worked tirelessly to save the innocent from slaughter.<\/p>",

The distinguished historian argues that democracy today is threatened not by the masses, as Jose Ortega y Gasset (<i>The Revolt of the Masses<\/i>) had said, but by the elites. These elites - mobile and increasingly global in outlook - refuse to accept limits or ties to nation and place. As they isolate themselves in their networks and enclaves, they abandon the middle class, divide the nation, and betray the idea of a democracy for all America's citizens. This is Lasch's clarion call for a return to the virtues of community, responsibility, and religion. <\/p>",

Should they hold those responsible for atrocities during the war accountable, or should they take the information to advance national interest? <\/p> <p>The researchers who worked at Unit 731, the biological and chemical warfare research and development unit, were given immunity in exchange for their research data. Unit 731 included factories filled with humans, tested with various diseases, as well as field tests on civilians of the Soviet Union and China. Imperial Japan had aspirations to develop operative tools of biological warfare, one of which was prohibited after World War I. Using living human captives, the Japanese scientists of the medical profession gathered data on the progression of the diseases until the \"human guinea pigs\" collapsed. Most of these scientists lived peacefully after WWII, with a few of them having to go through the Khabarovsk Trial, which was deemed by the West as communist propaganda.<\/p> <p>Most of the horrors on Unit 731 had been hearsays and rumors until recently with the passing of the Freedom of Information Act. This book is based on documents found in the US National Archives and Records Administration, Russian archival documents, and translations of the Khabarovsk Trial to paint a complete picture of the cover-up of the atrocious act of Unit 731.<\/p> <p>Listeners could expect to questions themselves with this evidence: Should war crimes be covered up in the name of national interest?<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>A revelatory history of how postcolonial African Independence movements were systematically undermined by one nation above all: the US.<\/b><\/p> <p>In 1958 in Accra, Ghana, the Hands Off Africa conference brought together the leading figures of African independence in a public show of political strength and purpose. Led by the charismatic Kwame Nkrumah, who had just won Ghana\u2019s independence, his determined call for Pan-Africanism was heeded by young, idealistic leaders across the continent and by African Americans seeking civil rights at home. Yet, a moment that signified a new era of African freedom simultaneously marked a new era of foreign intervention and control.<\/p> <p>In <i>White Malice<\/i>, Susan Williams unearths the covert operations pursued by the CIA from Ghana to the Congo to the UN in an effort to frustrate and deny Africa\u2019s new generation of nationalist leaders. This dramatically upends the conventional belief that the African nations failed to establish effective, democratic states on their own accord. As the old European powers moved out, the US moved in.<\/p> <p>Drawing on original research and recently declassified documents, and told through an engaging narrative, Williams introduces listeners to idealistic African leaders and to the secret agents, ambassadors, and even presidents who deliberately worked against them, forever altering the future of a continent.<\/p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b><\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>What happens when a society is run by people who are antisocial? Welcome to baby boomer America. <\/p> <p>In <i>A Generation of Sociopaths<\/i>, Bruce Cannon Gibney shows how America was hijacked by the boomers, a generation whose reckless self-indulgence degraded the foundations of American prosperity. A former partner in a leading venture capital firm, Gibney examines the disastrous policies of the most powerful generation in modern history, showing how the boomers ruthlessly enriched themselves at the expense of future generations. <\/p> <p>Acting without empathy, prudence, or respect for facts - acting, in other words, as sociopaths - the boomers turned American dynamism into stagnation, inequality, and bipartisan fiasco. The boomers have set a time bomb for the 2030s, when damage to Social Security, public finances, and the environment will become catastrophic and possibly irreversible - and when, not coincidentally, boomers will be dying off. <\/p> <p>Gibney, whose 2011 essay \"What Happened to the Future?\" transfixed the investment world, argues that younger generations have a fleeting window to hold the boomers accountable and begin restoring America. Distilling deep research into a witty, colorful indictment of the boomers and an urgent defense of the once-unquestioned value of society, <i>A Generation of Sociopaths<\/i> is poised to become one of the most controversial books of the year. <\/p>",

Since then, Fisher has conducted pioneering brain research on lust, romantic love, and attachment; gathered data on more than 80,000 people to explain why you love who you love; and collected information on more than 30,000 men and women on sexting, hooking up, friends with benefits, and other current trends in courtship and marriage. This is a cutting-edge tour de force that traces human family life from its origins in Africa over 20 million years ago to the Internet dating sites and bedrooms of today. It's got it all: the copulatory gaze and other natural courting ploys; the who, when, where, and why of adultery; love addictions; Fisher's discovery of four broad chemically based personality styles and what each seeks in romance; the newest data on worldwide (biologically based) patterns of divorce; how and why men and women think differently; the real story of women, men, and power; the rise - and fall - of the sexual double standard; and what brain science tells us about how to make and keep a happy partnership. <\/p>",

  "summary": "In this ambitious work, first published in 1983, Cedric Robinson demonstrates that efforts to understand Black people's history of resistance solely through the prism of Marxist theory are incomplete and inaccurate. Marxist analyses tend to presuppose European models of history and experience that downplay the significance of Black people and Black communities as agents of change and resistance. Black radicalism, Robinson argues, must be linked to the traditions of Africa and the unique experiences of Blacks on Western continents, and any analyses of African American history need to acknowledge this.\n To illustrate his argument, Robinson traces the emergence of Marxist ideology in Europe, the resistance by Blacks in historically oppressive environments, and the influence of both of these traditions on such important twentieth-century Black radical thinkers as W. E. B. Du Bois, C. L. R. James, and Richard Wright. This revised and updated third edition includes a new preface by Tiffany Willoughby-Herard, and a new foreword by Robin D. G. Kelley.",

  "summary": "<p>For decades, books about John or Robert Kennedy have woven either a shimmering tale of Camelot gallantry or a tawdry story of runaway ambition and reckless personal behavior. But the real story of the Kennedys in the 1960s has long been submerged - until now. In <i>Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years<\/i>, David Talbot sheds a dramatic new light on the tumultuous inner life of the Kennedy presidency and its stunning aftermath. Talbot, the founder of Salon.com, has written a gripping political history that is sure to be one of the most talked-about books of the year. <\/p> <p><i>Brothers<\/i> begins on the shattering afternoon of November 22, 1963, as a grief-stricken Robert Kennedy urgently demands answers about the assassination of his brother. Bobby\u2019s suspicions immediately focus on the nest of CIA spies, gangsters, and Cuban exiles that had long been plotting a violent regime change in Cuba. The Kennedys had struggled to control this swamp of anti-Castro intrigue based in southern Florida, but with little success. <\/p> <p><i>Brothers<\/i> then shifts back in time, revealing the shadowy conflicts that tore apart the Kennedy administration, pitting the young president and his even younger brother against their own national security apparatus. The Kennedy brothers and a small circle of their most trusted advisors - men like Theodore Sorensen, Robert McNamara, and Kenneth O\u2019Donnell, who were so close the Kennedys regarded them as family - repeatedly thwarted Washington\u2019s warrior caste. These hardline generals and spymasters were hell-bent on a showdown with the Communist foe - in Berlin, Laos, Vietnam, and especially Cuba. But the Kennedys continually frustrated their militaristic ambitions, pushing instead for a peaceful resolution to the Cold War. The tensions within the Kennedy administration were heading for an explosive climax, when a burst of gunfire in a sunny Dallas plaza terminated John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidency. <\/p> <p>Based on interviews with more than 150 people - including many of the Kennedys\u2019 aging \u201cband of brothers,\u201d whose testimony here might be their final word on this epic political story - as well as newly released government documents, <i>Brothers<\/i> reveals the compelling, untold story of the Kennedy years, including JFK\u2019s heroic efforts to keep the country out of a cataclysmic war and Bobby Kennedy\u2019s secret quest to solve his beloved brother\u2019s murder. Bobby\u2019s subterranean search was a dangerous one and led, in part, to his own quest for power in 1968, in a passion-filled campaign that ended with his own murder. As Talbot reveals here, RFK might have been the victim of the same plotters he suspected of killing his brother. This is historical storytelling at its riveting best - meticulously researched and movingly told. <\/p> <p><i>Brothers<\/i> is a sprawling narrative about the clash of powerful men and the darker side of the Cold War - a tale of tragic grandeur that is certain to change our understanding of the relentlessly fascinating Kennedy saga.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>For two centuries, the Framers' ideas about political corruption flourished in the courts, even in the absence of clear rules governing voters, civil officers, and elected officials. In the 1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court began to narrow the definition of corruption, and the meaning has since changed dramatically. No case makes that clearer than Citizens United. In 2010, one of the most consequential Court decisions in American political history gave wealthy corporations the right to spend unlimited money to influence elections. Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion treated corruption as nothing more than explicit bribery. With unlimited spending transforming American politics for the worse, Citizens United was not just bad law but bad history. <\/p> <p><i>Corruption in America<\/i> clearly shows that if the American experiment in self-government is to have a future, then we must revive the traditional meaning of corruption and embrace an old ideal.<\/p>",

Could the current rise of real-life robocops usher in a world that resembles <i>Ender's Game<\/i>? And sure, communism will bring an end to material scarcities and inequalities of wealth - but there's no guarantee that social hierarchies, governed by an economy of \"likes\", wouldn't rise to take their place. <\/p> <p>A whirlwind tour through science fiction, social theory and the new technologies already shaping our lives, <i>Four Futures<\/i> is a balance sheet of the socialisms we may reach if a resurgent Left is successful - and the barbarisms we may be consigned to if those movements fail. <\/p>",

Gripping new evidence shows what could have happened. <\/p> <p>When Truman asked Stalin in 1945 whether Hitler was dead, Stalin replied bluntly, \"No.\" As late as 1952, Eisenhower declared: \"We have been unable to unearth one bit of tangible evidence of Hitler's death.\" What really happened? Simon Dunstan and Gerrard Williams have compiled extensive evidence - some recently declassified - that Hitler actually fled Berlin and took refuge in a remote Nazi enclave in Argentina. The recent discovery that the famous \"Hitler's skull\" in Moscow is female, as well as newly uncovered documents, provide powerful proof for their case. Dunstan and Williams cite people, places, and dates in over 500 detailed notes that identify the plan's escape route, vehicles, aircraft, U-boats, and hideouts. Among the details: the CIA's possible involvement and Hitler's life in Patagonia - including his two daughters.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>For proslavery leaders like John C. Calhoun and Jefferson Davis, the 19th-century world was torn between two hostile forces: a rising movement against bondage and an Atlantic plantation system that was larger and more productive than ever before. In this great struggle, Southern statesmen saw the United States as slavery's most powerful champion. Overcoming traditional qualms about a strong central government, slaveholding leaders harnessed the power of the state to defend slavery abroad. During the antebellum years, they worked energetically to modernize the US military while steering American diplomacy to protect slavery in Brazil, Cuba, and the Republic of Texas. As Matthew Karp demonstrates, these leaders were nationalists, not separatists. Their \"vast Southern empire\" was not an independent South but the entire United States, and only the election of Abraham Lincoln broke their grip on national power. Fortified by years at the helm of US foreign affairs, slave-holding elites formed their own Confederacy - not only as a desperate effort to preserve their property but as a confident bid to shape the future of the Atlantic world. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Most people are both repelled and intrigued by the images of cold-blooded, conscienceless murderers that increasingly populate our movies, television programs, and newspaper headlines. With their flagrant criminal violation of society's rules, serial killers like Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy are among the most dramatic examples of the psychopath. Individuals with this personality disorder are fully aware of the consequences of their actions and know the difference between right and wrong, yet they are terrifyingly self-centered, remorseless, and unable to care about the feelings of others. Perhaps most frightening, they often seem completely normal to unsuspecting targets. Presenting a compelling portrait of these dangerous men and women based on 25 years of distinguished scientific research, Dr. Robert D. Hare vividly describes a world of con artists, hustlers, rapists, and other predators who charm, lie, and manipulate their way through life. Are psychopaths mad, or simply bad? How can they be recognized? And how can we protect ourselves? This book provides solid information and surprising insights for anyone seeking to understand this devastating condition.<\/p>",

  "summary": "\"A provocative history\" of intrigue and class struggle in ancient Rome - \"an important alternative to the usual views of Caesar and the Roman Empire\" (Publishers Weekly).\n Most historians, both ancient and modern, have viewed the Late Republic of Rome through the eyes of its rich nobility - the one percent of the population who controlled 99 percent of the empire's wealth. In The Assassination of Julius Caesar, Michael Parenti recounts this period, spanning the years 100 to 33 BC, from the perspective of the Roman people. In doing so, he presents a provocative, trenchantly researched narrative of popular resistance against a powerful elite.\n As Parenti carefully weighs the evidence concerning the murder of Caesar, he adds essential context to the crime with fascinating details about Roman society as a whole. In this book, we find reflections on the democratic struggle waged by Roman commoners, religious augury as an instrument of social control, the patriarchal oppression of women, and the political use of homophobic attacks. The Assassination of Julius Caesar offers a whole new perspective on an era thought to be well-known.",

  "summary": "<p>This is an ambitious, meticulous examination of how U.S. foreign policy since the 1960s has led to partial or total cover-ups of past domestic criminal acts, including, perhaps, the catastrophe of 9/11.<\/p> <p>Peter Dale Scott, whose previous books have investigated CIA involvement in southeast Asia, the drug wars, and the Kennedy assassination, here probes how the policies of presidents since Nixon have augmented the tangled bases for the 2001 terrorist attack. Scott shows how America's expansion into the world since World War II has led to momentous secret decision making at high levels. He demonstrates how these decisions by small cliques are responsive to the agendas of private wealth at the expense of the public, of the democratic state, and of civil society. He shows how, in implementing these agendas, U.S. intelligence agencies have become involved with terrorist groups they once backed and helped create, including al Qaeda.<\/p>",

  "summary": "All new - the first RFKLibrary.org original bootleg audiobook!\nNo audiobook existed, so we made one!\n\n\"One of the most disturbing moments of our time in South West Florida came when we sat down with two local law enforcement officials who could be considered fairly typical Southern Sheriffs, both of whom ventured the opinion that -- based on what they had witnessed of a 40-year long history of CIA-connected covert operations in their area -- they believed that the CIA was somehow involved in, if not responsible for, the World Trade Center attacks.\u201d \n\nWhat ARE they hiding down in Venice, Florida?\n\nVenice, Florida, where three of the four terrorist pilots learned to fly, is the biggest September 11 crime scene that wasn't reduced to rubble. Yet it has received no serious scrutiny for what it might reveal about the nature of the terrorist conspiracy that resulted in the 9-11 attack. Until now ...\n\nWelcome to Terrorland delves into this question and reveals the shocking results of a two-year investigation.\n\nInvestigative journalist Daniel Hopsicker went searching in Venice for evidence that Mohamed Atta and his Hamburg cadre received outside help while they were in the U.S. -- as authorities initially stated -- from a shadowy 'global network,' or even from foreign governments while Mohamed Atta and his Hamburg cadre of conspirators made it their 'home away from home' for a year and a half.\n\nThis is the story of Mohamed Atta, a black-hearted psychopath, in Florida, a pirate's paradise. If either had been different, September 11th might never have happened.\n\nThis book is packed with stunning revelations:\n\n\u2022 The attempt on the life of President George W. Bush on the morning of the 9-11 attack at his hotel in Sarasota, Florida\n\n\u2022 Mohamed Atta's American girlfriend, Amanda Keller, intimidated into silence by the FBI.\n\n\u2022 Atta's meeting in Key West with two German men who flew in just to see him, during a booze-and-drug-filled three day weekend.\n\n\u2022 Numerous eyewitnesses in Florida intimidated into silence by the FBI and discouraged from talking with reporters about what they saw, because what they saw and heard seriously contracts the 'official story' about the identity and activities of Atta and the other members of the terrorist conspiracy during their time in the U.S.\n\n* The history of narcotics trafficking through the two airports Atta frequented, and their use for over 40 years in covert operations of the U.S. Government\n\n* Welcome to TerrorLand uncovers evidence proving that, far from being merely negligent or asleep at the switch, the CIA was not only aware that hundreds of Arab \"student pilots\" had been flooding into Florida, but was actually running the operation.\n\nDaniel Hopsicker is the author of Barry & 'the boys' -- The CIA the Mob and America's Secret History, called \"the definitive text on the subject\" by at least one veteran of the Mena operation during Iran Contra. His investigative reporting appears in the MadCow Morning News [www.madcowprod.com] and probes into why, in the words of one famous Southern lawman: \"Things ain't always been jes' right 'round here.\"\n\n\"Hopsicker's reporting should already be as famous as that of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.\"\n\n\"The outrageous truth about the life of 9-11's terrorist ringleader Mohamed Atta doesn't come from America's National Commission of Inquiry, or the thousands of warrants issued by the FBI, or from cable news-channels or any other major media source, but from this book, the work of investigative reporter Daniel Hopsicker.\"\n\n- MATHIAS BROCKERS, AUTHOR OF THE BEST-SELLING GERMAN BOOK FACTS FORGERIES AND THE SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE OF 9/11",

  "summary": "Librivox.org Edition Remastered by RFKLibrary.org\n\nFew figures are more seminal in the abolitionist movement in America than John Brown. His firebrand approach to the movement arose out of his religiously inspired and deep-seated belief that slavery was not only morally unjust but that its removal from American society could only be achieved through armed insurrection.\n\nFollowing his capture in 1859 during an unsuccessful raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry and his subsequent hanging, he became an electrifying and symbolical figure for the abolitionist movement. Many historians argue that the incident at Harpers Ferry was the breaking point between pro- and anti-slavery forces that led to the secession of the southern states and the subsequent Civil War. \n\nProminent African American W. E. B. Du Bois chronicles the life of John Brown in this 1909 biography.

  "summary": "<p>In May 2013, Glenn Greenwald set out for Hong Kong to meet an anonymous source who claimed to have astonishing evidence of pervasive government spying and insisted on communicating only through heavily encrypted channels. That source turned out to be the 29-year-old NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and his revelations about the agency\u2019s widespread, systemic overreach proved to be some of the most explosive and consequential news in recent history, triggering a fierce debate over national security and information privacy. As the arguments rage on and the government considers various proposals for reform, it is clear that we have yet to see the full impact of Snowden\u2019s disclosures. <\/p> <p>Now for the first time, Greenwald fits all the pieces together, recounting his high-intensity 10-day trip to Hong Kong, examining the broader implications of the surveillance detailed in his reporting for <i>The Guardian<\/i>, and revealing fresh information on the NSA\u2019s unprecedented abuse of power with never-before-seen documents entrusted to him by Snowden himself. Going beyond NSA specifics, Greenwald also takes on the establishment media, excoriating their habitual avoidance of adversarial reporting on the government and their failure to serve the interests of the people. Finally, he asks what it means both for individuals and for a nation\u2019s political health when a government pries so invasively into the private lives of its citizens - and considers what safeguards and forms of oversight are necessary to protect democracy in the digital age. <\/p> <p>Coming at a landmark moment in American history, <i>No Place to Hide<\/i> is a fearless, incisive, and essential contribution to our understanding of the U.S. surveillance state.<\/p>",

Kennedy, his murder continues to haunt the American psyche and stands as a turning point in our nation\u2019s history. The Warren Commission rushed out its report in 1964, but questions continue to linger: Was there a conspiracy? Was there a coup at the highest levels of government? <\/p> <p>On March 1, 1967, New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison shocked the world by arresting local businessman Clay Shaw for conspiracy to murder the president. His alleged co-conspirator, David Ferrie, had been found dead a few days before. Garrison charged that elements of the United States government, in particular the CIA, were behind the crime. From the beginning, his probe was virulently attacked in the media and violently denounced from Washington. His office was infiltrated and sabotaged, and witnesses disappeared and died strangely. Eventually, Shaw was acquitted after the briefest of jury deliberation and the only prosecution ever brought for the murder of President Kennedy was over. <\/p> <p>Returning to audiences for the first time in years, <i>On the Trail of the Assassins<\/i> - the primary source material for Oliver Stone\u2019s hit film <i>JFK<\/i> - is Garrison\u2019s own account of his investigations into the background of Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy, and his prosecution of Clay Shaw in the trial that followed.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>The \u201cremarkable\u201d story of America's secret post-WWII science programs (<i>The Boston Globe<\/i>), from the <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author of <i>Area 51<\/i>.<\/p> <p>In the chaos following World War II, the US government faced many difficult decisions, including what to do with the Third Reich's scientific minds. These were the brains behind the Nazis' once-indomitable war machine. So began Operation Paperclip, a decades-long, covert project to bring Hitler's scientists and their families to the United States.<\/p> <p>Many of these men were accused of war crimes, and others had stood trial at Nuremberg; one was convicted of mass murder and slavery. They were also directly responsible for major advances in rocketry, medical treatments, and the US Space Program. Was Operation Paperclip a moral outrage, or did it help America win the Cold War?<\/p> <p>Drawing on exclusive interviews with dozens of Paperclip family members, colleagues, and interrogators, and with access to German archival documents (including previously unseen papers made available by direct descendants of the Third Reich's ranking members), files obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, and dossiers discovered in government archives and at Harvard University, Annie Jacobsen follows more than a dozen German scientists through their postwar lives and into a startling, complex, nefarious, and jealously guarded government secret of the 20th century.<\/p> <p>In this definitive, controversial look at one of America's most strategic, and disturbing, government programs, Jacobsen shows just how dark government can get in the name of national security.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>A pathbreaking history of the United States' overseas possessions and the true meaning of its empire <\/b><\/p> <p>We are familiar with maps that outline all 50 states. And we are also familiar with the idea that the United States is an \"empire\", exercising power around the world. But what about the actual territories - the islands, atolls, and archipelagos - this country has governed and inhabited? In <i>How to Hide an Empire<\/i>, Daniel Immerwahr tells the fascinating story of the United States outside the United States. In crackling, fast-paced prose, he reveals forgotten episodes that cast American history in a new light. <\/p> <p>We travel to the Guano Islands, where prospectors collected one of the 19th century's most valuable commodities, and the Philippines, site of the most destructive event on US soil. In Puerto Rico, Immerwahr reveals how US doctors conducted grisly experiments they would never have conducted on the mainland and charts the emergence of independence fighters who would shoot up the US Congress. In the years after World War II, Immerwahr notes, the United States moved away from colonialism. Instead, it put innovations in electronics, transportation, and culture to use, devising a new sort of influence that did not require the control of colonies. Rich with absorbing vignettes, full of surprises, and driven by an original conception of what empire and globalization mean today, <i>How to Hide an Empire<\/i> is a major and fully enjoyable work of history.<\/p>",

Every month and every year that goes by, we find out more positive things about it. Marijuana has been demonized through the years, but obviously this plant has a great deal of positive attributes, and it's a renewable resource. <\/p> <p>Being a cash crop, marijuana is bad for the pharmaceutical industry. Is Big Pharma pressuring the government to continue to deny sick people access? If so, that's truly a crime against American citizens. And, as Jesse Ventura writes, \"Our government won't do the right thing and legalize marijuana unless we the people demand it, because there are so many people within our government on the payroll, all thanks to the War on Drugs.\" <\/p> <p><i>Jesse Ventura's Marijuana Manifesto<\/i> calls for an end to the War on Drugs. Just because something is illegal, that doesn't mean it goes away; it just means that criminals run it. Legalizing marijuana will serve to rejuvenate our pathetic economy and just might make people a little happier. Ventura's book will show us all how we can take our country back. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin. <\/b><\/p> <p>The United States is the richest country on earth, yet has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. One in seven Americans live below the poverty line, a line which hasn't shifted over the last fifty years, despite the efforts of successive governments and extensive relief programs. Why is there so much scarcity in this land of dollars?<\/p> <p>In <i>Poverty, by America<\/i>, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond examines the nature of American poverty today and the stories we tell ourselves about it. Spanning racism, social isolation, mass incarceration, the housing crisis, domestic violence, crack and opioid epidemics, welfare cuts and more, Desmond argues that poverty does not result from a lack of resources or good policy ideas. We already know how to eliminate it. The hard part is getting more of us to care.<\/p> <p>To do so, we need a new story. As things stand, liberals explain poverty through insurmountable structural issues, whereas conservatives highlight personal failings and poor life choices. Both analyses abdicate responsibility, and ignore the reality that the advantages of the rich only come at the expense of the poor. It is time better-paid citizens put themselves back in the narrative, recognizing that the depth and expanse of poverty in any nation reflects our failure to look out for one another. Poverty must ultimately be met by community: all this suffering and want is our doing, and we can undo it.<\/p>",

We live in an age of winners and losers, where the odds are stacked in favour of the already fortunate. Stalled social mobility and entrenched inequality give the lie to the promise that 'you can make it if you try'. And the consequence is a brew of anger and frustration that has fuelled populist protest, with the triumph of Brexit and election of Donald Trump.  <\/p> <p>Michael J. Sandel argues that to overcome the polarised politics of our time, we must rethink the attitudes toward success and failure that have accompanied globalisation and rising inequality. Sandel highlights the hubris a meritocracy generates among the winners and the harsh judgement it imposes on those left behind. He offers an alternative way of thinking about success - more attentive to the role of luck in human affairs, more conducive to an ethic of humility and more hospitable to a politics of the common good.<\/p>",

It isn't. <\/p> <p>From the Silent Generation to Baby Boomers, from Generation X to Millennials and Generation Z, we all have a stake in understanding the real story about Social Security. Critical to addressing the looming retirement crisis that will affect two-thirds of today's workers, Social Security is a powerful program that can help stop the collapse of the middle class, lessen the pressure squeezing families from all directions, and help end the upward redistribution of wealth that has resulted in perilous levels of inequality. <\/p> <p>All Americans deserve to have dignified retirement years as well as an umbrella to protect them and their families in the event of disability or premature death. Sure to be a game-changer, <i>Social Security Works!<\/i> cogently presents the issues and sets forth both an agenda and a political strategy that will benefit us all.

This is why he's wrong. <\/p> <p>In his more than 30 years as an NCIS special agent and counterintelligence officer, Mark Fallon has investigated some of the most significant terrorist operations in US history, including the first bombing of the World Trade Center and the 2000 attack on the USS <i>Cole<\/i>. He knew well how to bring criminals to justice, all the while upholding the Constitution. <\/p> <p>But in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, it was clear that America was dealing with a new kind of enemy. Soon after the attacks, Fallon was named deputy commander of the newly formed Criminal Investigation Task Force (CITF), created to probe the al-Qaeda terrorist network and bring suspected terrorists to trial. Fallon was determined to do the job the right way, but with the opening of Guantanamo Bay and the arrival of its detainees, he witnessed a shadowy dark side of the intelligence community that emerged, peddling a snake-oil they called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\". <\/p> <p>In <i>Unjustifiable Means<\/i>, Fallon reveals this dark side of the US government, which threw our own laws and international covenants aside to become a nation that tortured - sanctioned by the highest-ranking members of the Bush administration, the army, and the CIA, many of whom still hold government positions, although none has been held accountable. Until now. <\/p> <p>Follow along as Fallon pieces together how this shadowy group incrementally - and secretly - loosened the reins on interrogation techniques at Gitmo and later Abu-Ghraib and black sites around the world. He recounts how key psychologists disturbingly violated human rights and adopted harsh practices to fit the Bush administration's objectives even though such tactics proved ineffective, counterproductive, and damaging to our own national security. Fallon untangles the powerful decisions the administration's legal team - the Bush \"War Counsel\" - used to provide the cover needed to make torture the modus operandi of the US government. As Fallon says, \"You could clearly see it coming. You could wave your arms and yell, but there wasn't a damn thing you could do to stop it.\" <\/p> <p><i>Unjustifiable Means<\/i> is hard-hitting, raw, and explosive and forces the spotlight back on to how America lost its way. Fallon also exposes those responsible for using torture under the guise of national security as well as those heroes who risked it all to oppose the program. By casting a defining light on one of America's darkest periods, Mark Fallon weaves a cautionary tale for those who wield the power to reinstate torture. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Few institutions are as loved, as loathed, and as historically important as the United States Postal Service, the subject of this landmark century-spanning social, political, and economic history. <\/p> <p>The United States Postal Service is a wondrous American creation. Seven days a week, its army of 300,000 letter carriers delivers 513 million pieces of mail, 40 percent of the world's volume. It is far more efficient than any other mail service - more than twice as efficient as the Japanese and easily outpacing the Germans and British. And the USPS has a storied history. <\/p> <p>Founded by Benjamin Franklin, it was the information network that bound far-flung Americans together, fostered a common culture, and helped American business to prosper. A first class stamp remains one of the greatest bargains of all time, and yet the USPS is slowly vanishing. Critics say it is slow and archaic. Mail volume is down. The workforce is shrinking. Post offices are closing. <\/p> <p>In <i>Neither Snow nor Rain<\/i>, journalist Devin Leonard tackles the fascinating, centuries-long history of the USPS, from the first letter carriers through Franklin's days, when postmasters worked out of their homes and post roads cut new paths through the wilderness. Under Andrew Jackson, the post office was molded into a vast patronage machine, and by the 1870s, over 70 percent of federal employees were postal workers. As the country boomed, USPS aggressively developed new technology, from mobile post offices on railroads and air mail service to mechanical sorting machines and optical character readers. <\/p> <p><i>Neither Snow nor Rain<\/i> is a rich, multifaceted history full of remarkable characters, from the stamp-collecting FDR to the revolutionaries who challenged USPS' monopoly on mail to the renegade union members who brought the system - and the country - to a halt in the 1970s. An exciting and engrossing listen, <i>Neither Snow nor Rain<\/i> is the first major history of the USPS in over 50 years. <\/p>",

The next anybody heard from her, this genteel, farm-reared, 67-year-old great-grandmother had walked 800 miles along the 2,050-mile Appalachian Trail. And in September 1955, atop Maine's Mount Katahdin, she sang the first verse of \"America, the Beautiful\" and proclaimed, \"I said I'll do it, and I've done it.\" Grandma Gatewood, as the reporters called her, became the first woman to hike the entire Appalachian Trail alone, as well as the first person - man or woman - to walk it twice and three times. The public attention she brought to the little-known footpath was unprecedented. Her vocal criticism of the lousy, difficult stretches led to bolstered maintenance, and very likely saved the trail from extinction.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Between 1959 and 1989, Soviet scientists and officials made numerous attempts to network their nation - to construct a nationwide computer network. None of these attempts succeeded, and the enterprise had been abandoned by the time the Soviet Union fell apart. Meanwhile, ARPANET, the American precursor to the Internet, went online in 1969. Why did the Soviet network, with top-level scientists and patriotic incentives, fail while the American network succeeded? In <i>How Not to Network a Nation<\/i>, Benjamin Peters reverses the usual Cold War dualities and argues that the American ARPANET took shape thanks to well-managed state subsidies and collaborative research environments, and the Soviet network projects stumbled because of unregulated competition among self-interested institutions, bureaucrats, and others. The capitalists behaved like socialists, while the socialists behaved like capitalists. <\/p> <p>After examining the midcentury rise of cybernetics, the science of self-governing systems, and the emergence in the Soviet Union of economic cybernetics, Peters complicates this uneasy role reversal while chronicling the various Soviet attempts to build a \"unified information network.\" Drawing on previously unknown archival and historical materials, he focuses on the final, and most ambitious of these projects, the All-State Automated System of Management (OGAS), and its principal promoter, Viktor M. Glushkov. Peters describes the rise and fall of OGAS - its theoretical and practical reach, its vision of a national economy managed by network, the bureaucratic obstacles it encountered, and the institutional stalemate that killed it. Finally, he considers the implications of the Soviet experience for today's networked world. <\/p>",

McKay presents a carefully documented and sensitively written account of the life of Gaetan Dugas, a gay man whose skin cancer diagnosis in 1980 took on very different meanings as the HIV/AIDS epidemic developed - and who received widespread posthumous infamy when he was incorrectly identified as patient zero of the North American outbreak. <\/p> <p>McKay shows how investigators from the US Centers for Disease Control inadvertently created the term amid their early research into the emerging health crisis; how an ambitious journalist dramatically amplified the idea in his determination to reframe national debates about AIDS; and how many individuals grappled with the notion of patient zero-adopting, challenging, and redirecting its powerful meanings - as they tried to make sense of and respond to the first 15 years of an unfolding epidemic. With important insights for our interconnected age, <i>Patient Zero<\/i> untangles the complex process by which individuals and groups create meaning and allocate blame when faced with new disease threats. What McKay gives us here is myth-smashing revisionist history at its best. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>For fans of <i>A Street Cat Named Bob<\/i> and <i>Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World<\/i>, <i>Strays<\/i> is a compelling true story of a man who rescues a stray, injured cat and how they save each other. <\/p> <p>Homeless, alcoholic, and depressed, Michael King lives in a UPS loading bay on the wrong side of the tracks in Portland, Oregon. One rainy night, he stumbles upon a hurt, starving, scruffy cat and takes her in. Nursing her back to health, he names her Tabor, and she becomes a bit of a celebrity in Southeast Portland. When winter comes, they travel from Oregon to the beaches of California and to the high plains of Montana, surviving blizzards and bears, angry steers and rainstorms. Along the way people are drawn to the spirited, beautiful cat and moved to help Michael, who cuts a striking figure with Tabor riding high on his backpack or walking on a leash. <\/p> <p>Tabor comforts Michael when he's down, giving Michael someone to love and care for, and inspiring him to get sober and to come to terms with his past family traumas and grief over the death of his life partner. As they make their way across the West Coast, the pair become inseparable, healing the scars of each other's troubled pasts. But when Michael takes Tabor to a veterinarian in Montana, he discovers that Tabor has an identification chip and an owner in Portland who has never given up hope of finding his beloved cat. Michael makes the difficult choice to return to Portland and reunite Tabor with her owner. Now Michael must create a new purpose in his life after Tabor. <\/p> <p>The authentic tale of an adventurous and charismatic cat and her compassionate human admirers, Strays proves the healing power of love and the profound bond between humans and animals. <\/p>",

Jeff Ryan shares the story of how this quintessentially Japanese company found success in the American market. Lawsuits, Hollywood, die-hard fans, and face-offs with Sony and Microsoft are all part of the drama. Find out about: Mario\u2019s eccentric yet brilliant creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, who was tapped for the job because he was considered expendable; Minoru Arakawa, the son-in-law of Nintendo\u2019s imperious president, who bumbled his way to success; and the unexpected approach that allowed Nintendo to reinvent itself as the gaming system for the nongamer, especially now with the Wii.<\/p> <p>Even those who can\u2019t tell a Koopa from a Goomba will find this a fascinating story of striving, comeuppance, and redemption.<\/p>",

But that support stemmed less from his wild charges about communists than his more substantiated charges that \"sex perverts\" had infiltrated government agencies.

Warning of a spreading homosexual menace, McCarthy and his Republican allies learned how to win votes.<\/p> <p>Winner of three book awards, <i>The Lavender Scare<\/i> masterfully traces the origins of contemporary sexual politics to Cold War hysteria over national security. Drawing on newly declassified documents and interviews with former government officials, historian David Johnson chronicles how the myth that homosexuals threatened national security determined government policy for decades, ruined thousands of lives, and pushed many to suicide. As Johnson shows, this myth not only outlived McCarthy but, by the 1960s, helped launch a new civil rights struggle.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>When Annette Gordon-Reed's groundbreaking study was first published, rumors of Thomas Jefferson's sexual involvement with his slave Sally Hemings had circulated for two centuries. Among all aspects of Jefferson's renowned life, it was perhaps the most hotly contested topic. The publication of <i>Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings<\/i> intensified this debate by identifying glaring inconsistencies in many noted scholars' evaluations of the existing evidence. In this study, Gordon-Reed assembles a fascinating and convincing argument: not that the alleged 38-year liaison necessarily took place but rather that the evidence for its taking place has been denied a fair hearing.<\/p> <p>Friends of Jefferson sought to debunk the Hemings story as early as 1800, and most subsequent historians and biographers followed suit, finding the affair unthinkable based upon their view of Jefferson's life, character, and beliefs. Gordon-Reed responds to these critics by pointing out numerous errors and prejudices in their writings, ranging from inaccurate citations, to impossible time lines, to virtual exclusions of evidence - especially evidence concerning the Hemings family. She demonstrates how these scholars may have been misguided by their own biases and may even have tailored evidence to serve and preserve their opinions of Jefferson.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In 2014, <i>Time <\/i>magazine announced that America had reached \"the transgender tipping point,\" suggesting that transgender issues would become the next civil rights frontier. Years later, many people - even many LGBTQ allies - still lack understanding of gender identity and the transgender experience. Into this void, Austen Hartke offers a biblically based, educational, and affirming resource to shed light and wisdom on this modern gender landscape.  <\/p> <p><i>Transforming: The Bible and the Lives of Transgender Christians<\/i> provides access into an underrepresented and misunderstood community and will change the way listeners think about transgender people, faith, and the future of Christianity. By introducing transgender issues and language and providing stories of both biblical characters and real-life narratives from transgender Christians living today, Hartke helps listeners visualize a more inclusive Christianity, equipping them with the confidence and tools to change both the church and the world.<\/p>",

As Zinn shows, many of our country's greatest battles - the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women's rights, racial equality - were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance.<\/p> <p>Covering Christopher Columbus' arrival through President Clinton's first term, <i>A People's History of the United States<\/i> features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history.<\/p>",

Hormel - a man who grew up feeling different not only because his family owned the Hormel \u201cempire\u201d and lived in a 26 bedroom house in a small Midwest town, but because he was gay at a time when homosexuality was not discussed or accepted. Outwardly he tried to live up to the life his father wanted for him - he was a successful professional, had married a lovely woman, and had children - but as volatile changes in the late 1960s impeded on the American psyche, Hormel realized that he could not hide his true self forever. Hormel moved to New York City, became an antiwar activist, battled homophobia, lost dear friends to AIDS, and set out to become America\u2019s first openly gay ambassador, a position he finally won during the Clinton administration. Today, Hormel continues to fight for LGBT equality and gay marriage rights. This is a passionate and inspiring true story of the determination for human equality and for attaining your own version of the American Dream - life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness without exception.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>This is the story of the greatest of all philosophical friendships - and how it influenced modern thought.<\/p> <p>David Hume is widely regarded as the most important philosopher ever to write in English, but during his lifetime, he was attacked as \"the Great Infidel\" for his skeptical religious views and deemed unfit to teach the young. In contrast, Adam Smith was a revered professor of moral philosophy and is now often hailed as the founding father of capitalism. Remarkably, the two were best friends for most of their adult lives, sharing what Dennis Rasmussen calls the greatest of all philosophical friendships.<\/p> <p><i>The Infidel and the Professor<\/i> is the first audiobook to tell the fascinating story of the friendship of these towering Enlightenment thinkers - and how it influenced their world-changing ideas. The audiobook follows Hume and Smith's relationship from their first meeting in 1749, until Hume's death in 1776. It describes how they commented on each other's writings, supported each other's careers and literary ambitions, and advised each other on personal matters, most notably after Hume's quarrel with Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Members of a vibrant intellectual scene in Enlightenment Scotland, Hume and Smith made many of the same friends (and enemies), joined the same clubs, and were interested in many of the same subjects well beyond philosophy and economics - from psychology and history to politics and Britain's conflict with the American colonies.<\/p> <p>The audiobook reveals that Smith's private religious views were considerably closer to Hume's public ones than is usually believed. It also shows that Hume contributed more to economics - and Smith contributed more to philosophy - than is generally recognized. Vividly written,<i> The Infidel and the Professor <\/i>is a compelling account of a great friendship that had great consequences for modern thought.<\/p>",

  "summary": "Most of the world remembers Crazy Horse as a peerless warrior who brought the U.S. Army to its knees at the Battle of Little Bighorn. But to his fellow Lakota Indians, he was a dutiful son and humble fighting man who, with valor, spirit, respect, and unparalleled leadership, fought for his people's land, livelihood, and honor. In this fascinating biography, Joseph Marshall, himself a Lakota Indian, creates a vibrant portrait of the man, his times, and his legacy. <p>Drawing on firsthand research and his culture's rich oral tradition (rarely shared outside the Native American community), Marshall reveals many aspects of Crazy Horse's life, including details of the powerful vision that convinced him of his duty to help preserve the Lakota homeland, a vision that changed the course of Crazy Horse's life and spurred him confidently into battle time and time again.<\/p> <p> <i>The Journey of Crazy Horse<\/i> is the true story of how one man's fight for his people's survival roused his true genius as a strategist, commander, and trusted leader. And it is an unforgettable portrayal of a revered human being and a profound celebration of a culture, a community, and an enduring way of life.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations<\/i> is one of the most important and influential works ever published on economic theory and is the foundation of classical economics. In it, Adam Smith stresses the importance of the division of labor to economic progress. He criticizes the arguments for economic planning and offers a detailed theoretical and historical case for free trade. <\/p> <p>In this masterpiece of the 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment, Smith develops a theory of social order arising from the unintended consequences of self-interested behavior. This self-regulating system of the free market, Smith contends, protects consumers from entrenched special interests and is usually harmed by government intervention. <\/p> <p>Far more than just a work on economic theory, <i>The Wealth of Nations<\/i> also contains Smith\u2019s views on philosophy, history, and political theory. <\/p> <p>This program discusses Adam Smith\u2019s general approach to philosophy and how <i>The Wealth of Nations<\/i> fits into that approach. It also explains Smith\u2019s major arguments and themes. Smith\u2019s sometimes difficult discourse is presented with the background information necessary for its comprehension. <\/p> <p>The Giants of Political Thought series is an easy and entertaining way to broaden your mind and your awareness of great ideas.<\/p> <p><\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>The hallmarks of America\u2019s War on Terror have been repeated long deployments and a high percentage of troops returning with psychological problems. Family members of combat veterans are at a higher risk of potentially lethal domestic violence than almost any other demographic; it\u2019s estimated that one in four children of active-duty service members has symptoms of depression; and nearly one million veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan require increased care due to physical or psychological trauma. But, despite these staggering trends, civilian America has not been mobilized to take care of the families left behind; the American home front, which traditionally has been rallied to support the nation\u2019s war efforts, has disappeared. <\/p><p>In <i>Homefront 911<\/i> Stacy Bannerman, a nationally recognized advocate for military families, provides an insider\u2019s view of how more than a decade of war has contributed to the emerging crisis we are experiencing in today\u2019s military and veteran families as they battle with overwhelmed VA offices, a public they feel doesn\u2019t understand their sacrifices, and a nation that still isn\u2019t fully prepared to help those who have given so much. Bannerman, whose husband served in Iraq, describes how extended deployments cause cumulative, long-lasting strain on families who may not see their parent, child, or spouse for months on end. She goes on to share the tools she and others have found to begin to heal their families and advocates policies for advancing programs, services, and civilian support, all to help repair the broken agreement that the nation will care for its returning soldiers and their families. <\/p>",

Seventeen days later, a Florida journalist died of inhalational anthrax. The death from the rare disease made world news.

It killed five people, disfigured at least 18 more, and launched the largest investigation in the FBI's history.<\/p> <p><i>Recounting the Anthrax Attacks <\/i>explores the origins of the innovative forensics used in this case, while also explaining their historical context. R. Scott Decker's team pursued its first suspect with dogged determination before realizing that the evidence did not add up. With renewed energy, they turned to non-traditional forensics - scientific initiatives never before applied to an investigation - as they continued to hunt for clues. These advances formed the new science of microbial forensics, a novel discipline that produced critical leads when traditional methods failed. The new technologies helped identify a second suspect - one who possessed the knowledge and skills to unleash a living weapon of mass destruction.<\/p>",

In <i>Training for Catastrophe<\/i>, author Lindsay Thomas shows how our security regime reimagines plausibility to focus on unlikely and even unreal events rather than probable ones. With an in-depth focus on preparedness (a pivotal, emergent national security paradigm since 9/11) she explores how fiction shapes national security.<\/p> <p>Thomas finds fiction at work in unexpected settings, from policy documents and workplace training manuals to comics and video games. Through these texts - as well as plenty of science fiction - she examines the philosophy of preparedness, interrogating the roots of why it asks us to treat explicitly fictional events as real. Thomas connects this philosophical underpinning to how preparedness plays out in contemporary politics, emphasizing how it uses aesthetic elements like realism, genre, character, and plot to train people both to regard some disasters as normal and to ignore others.<\/p> <p><i>Training for Catastrophe<\/i> makes an important case for how these documents elicit consent and compliance. Thomas draws from a huge archive of texts to ask difficult questions about the uses and values of fiction.<\/p>",

It also explores why Kennedy believes Skakel has yet to receive a fair trial, and why he demands the original verdict be overturned. <\/p>",

Lawrence, Henry Miller, Norman Mailer, and Jean Genet - and builds a damning profile of literature's patriarchal myths and their extension into psychology, philosophy, and politics. Her eloquence and popular examples taught a generation to recognize inequities masquerading as nature and proved the value of feminist critique in all facets of life. \n This new edition features the scholar Catharine A. MacKinnon and The New Yorker correspondent Rebecca Mead on the importance of Millett's work to challenging the complacency that sidelines feminism.",

  "summary": "<p>A shocking expos of the covert CIA program of widespread torture, rape, and murder of civilians during America\u2019s war in Vietnam, with a new introduction by the author. In the darkest days of the Vietnam War, America\u2019s Central Intelligence Agency secretly initiated a sweeping program of kidnap, torture, and assassination devised to destabilize the infrastructure of the National Liberation Front (NLF) of South Vietnam, commonly known as the \u201cViet Cong.\u201d The victims of the Phoenix Program were Vietnamese civilians, male and female, suspected of harboring information about the enemy - though many on the blacklist were targeted by corrupt South Vietnamese security personnel looking to extort money or remove a rival. Between 1965 and 1972, more than eighty thousand noncombatants were \u201cneutralized,\u201d as men and women alike were subjected to extended imprisonment without trial, horrific torture, brutal rape, and in many cases execution, all under the watchful eyes of US government agencies.Based on extensive research and in-depth interviews with former participants and observers, Douglas Valentine\u2019s startling expos blows the lid off of what was possibly the bloodiest and most inhumane covert operation in the CIA\u2019s history.The ebook edition includes \u201cThe Phoenix Has Landed,\u201d a new introduction that addresses the \u201cPhoenix-style network\u201d that constitutes America\u2019s internal security apparatus today. Residents on American soil are routinely targeted under the guise of protecting us from terrorism - which is why, more than ever, people need to understand what Phoenix is all about.<\/p>",

  "summary": "What Is to Be Done? Burning Questions of Our Movement (1902) is a political pamphlet written by the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. Lenin contends that the working class will not become politically aware simply by struggling with employers over wages, hours and working conditions. He maintains that Marxists should form a political party of committed revolutionaries to spread Marxist political ideas among the workers. \n The pamphlet was partly responsible for the split of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party into Lenin's Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. Claiming that socialist theory was the product of the \"revolutionary socialist intellectuals\", Lenin states that the working class was able to develop only a \u201ctrade-union consciousness\". He points out that Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, the founders of modern scientific socialism, belonged to this bourgeois intelligentsia.",

  "summary": "<p>The American standard system of measurement is a unique and odd thing to behold, with its esoteric, inconsistent standards: 12 inches in a foot, three feet in a yard, 16 ounces in a pound, 100 pennies to the dollar. For something as elemental as counting and estimating the world around us, it seems like a confusing tool to use. So how did we end up with it? Most of the rest of the world is on the metric system, and for a time in the 1970s America appeared ready to make the switch. Yet it never happened, and the reasons for that get to the root of who we think we are, just as the measurements are woven into the ways we think. <\/p><p>John Marciano chronicles the origins of measurement systems, the kaleidoscopic array of standards throughout Europe and the 13 American colonies, the combination of intellect and circumstance that resulted in the metric system's creation in France in the wake of the French Revolution, and America's stubborn adherence to the hybrid United States Customary System ever since. As much as it is a tale of quarters and tenths, it is a human drama, replete with great inventors, visionary presidents, obsessive activists, and science-loving technocrats. Anyone who listens to this inquisitive, engaging story will never read Robert Frost's line \"miles to go before I sleep\" or eat a foot-long sub again without wondering, \"Whatever happened to the metric system?\"<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>With her characteristic brilliance, grace, and radical audacity, Angela Y. Davis has put the case for the latest abolition movement in American life: the abolition of the prison. As she quite correctly notes, American life is replete with abolition movements, and when they were engaged in these struggles, their chances of success seemed almost unthinkable. For generations of Americans, the abolition of slavery was sheerest illusion. Similarly, the entrenched system of racial segregation seemed to last forever, and generations lived in the midst of the practice, with few predicting its passage from custom. The brutal, exploitative (dare one say lucrative?) convict-lease system that succeeded formal slavery reaped millions to southern jurisdictions (and untold miseries for tens of thousands of men, and women). Few predicted its passing from the American penal landscape. Davis expertly argues how social movements transformed these social, political, and cultural institutions, and made such practices untenable.<\/p> <p>In <i>Are Prisons Obsolete?<\/i>, Professor Davis seeks to illustrate that the time for the prison is approaching an end. She argues forthrightly for \"decarceration,\" and argues for the transformation of the society as a whole.<\/p>",

He paid prostitutes to lure clients to CIA-run bordellos, where they were secretly dosed with mind-altering drugs.

Only once did someone manage to put a stop to any of it.<\/p> <p>Senator Frank Church of Idaho was an unlikely hero. He led congressional opposition to the Vietnam War and had become a scathing, radical critic of what he saw as American imperialism around the world. But he was still politically ambitious, privately yearning for acceptance from the foreign policy establishment that he hated and eager to run for president. Despite his flaws, Church would show historic strength in his greatest moment, when in the wake of Watergate he was suddenly tasked with investigating abuses of power in the intelligence community. The dark truths that Church exposed\u2014from assassination plots by the CIA, to links between the Kennedy dynasty and the mafia, to the surveillance of civil rights activists by the NSA and FBI\u2014would shake the nation to its core, and forever change the way that Americans thought about not only their government but also their ability to hold it accountable.<\/p> <p>Drawing upon hundreds of interviews, thousands of pages of recently declassified documents, and reams of unpublished letters, notes, and memoirs, some of which remain sensitive today, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter James Risen tells the gripping, untold story of truth and integrity standing against unchecked power\u2014and winning\u2014in <i>The Last Honest Man<\/i>.<\/p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b><\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>During the 19th century, the United States entered the ranks of the world's most advanced and dynamic economies. At the same time, the nation sustained an expansive and brutal system of human bondage. This was no mere coincidence. <i>Slavery's Capitalism<\/i> argues for slavery's centrality to the emergence of American capitalism in the decades between the Revolution and the Civil War. According to editors Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman, the issue is not whether slavery itself was or was not capitalist but rather the impossibility of understanding the nation's spectacular pattern of economic development without situating slavery front and center. American capitalism - renowned for its celebration of market competition, private property, and the self-made man - has its origins in an American slavery predicated on the abhorrent notion that human beings could be legally owned and compelled to work under force of violence. <\/p> <p>Drawing on the expertise of 16 scholars who are at the forefront of rewriting the history of American economic development, <i>Slavery's Capitalism<\/i> identifies slavery as the primary force driving key innovations in entrepreneurship, finance, accounting, management, and political economy that are too often attributed to the so-called free market. Approaching the study of slavery as the originating catalyst for the Industrial Revolution and modern capitalism casts new light on American credit markets, practices of offshore investment, and understandings of human capital. Rather than seeing slavery as outside the institutional structures of capitalism, the essayists recover slavery's importance to the American economic past and prompt enduring questions about the relationship of market freedom to human freedom. <\/p> <p>Contributors: Edward E.

  "summary": "<p>From World War II to the Cold War, Angleton operated beyond the view of the public, Congress, and even the president. He unwittingly shared intelligence secrets with Soviet spy Kim Philby, a member of the notorious Cambridge spy ring. He launched mass surveillance by opening the mail of hundreds of thousands of Americans. He abetted a scheme to aid Israel's own nuclear efforts, disregarding US security. He committed perjury and obstructed the JFK assassination investigation. He oversaw a massive spying operation on the antiwar and black nationalist movements and he initiated an obsessive search for communist moles that nearly destroyed the Agency. <\/p> <p>In <i>The Ghost<\/i>, investigative reporter Jefferson Morley tells Angleton's dramatic story, from his friendship with the poet Ezra Pound through the underground gay milieu of mid-century Washington to the Kennedy assassination to the Watergate scandal. From the agency's MKULTRA mind-control experiments to the wars of the Mideast, Angleton wielded far more power than anyone knew. Yet, during his seemingly lawless reign in the CIA, he also proved himself to be a formidable adversary to our nation's enemies, acquiring a mythic stature within the CIA that continues to this day. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Virtually anyone, anywhere knows that six million Jewish human beings were killed in the Jewish Holocaust. But how many African human beings were killed in the Black Holocaust - from the start of the European slave trade (c. 1500) to the Civil War (1865)? And how many were enslaved? <\/p> <p>The Black Holocaust, a travesty that killed millions of African human beings, is the most underreported major event in world history. A major economic event for Europe and Asia, a near fatal event for Africa, the seminal event in the history of every African American - if not every American! - and most of us cannot answer the simplest question about it. Here is a sample of what you will get from the painstakingly researched, painfully honest <i>The Black Holocaust for Beginners<\/i>:<\/p> <p>\"The total number of slaves imported is not known. It is estimated that nearly 900,000 came to America in the 16th century, two-and-three-quarter million in the 17th century, seven million in the 18th, and over four million in the 19th - perhaps 15 million in total. Probably every slave imported represented, on average, five corpses in Africa or on the high seas. The American slave trade, therefore, meant the elimination of at least 60 million Africans from their fatherland.\"<\/p>",

Fehrenbach brilliantly delineates the contrasts and conflicts between them, unraveling the history while weaving a fascinating tapestry of beauty and brutality: the Amerindians, who wrought from the vulnerable land a great indigenous Meso-American civilization by the first millennium BC; the successive reigns of Olmec, Maya, Toltec, and Mexic masters, who ruled through an admirably efficient bureaucracy and the power of the priests, propitiating the capricious gods with human sacrifices; the Spanish conquistadors, who used smallpox, technology, and their own ruthless individualism to erect a new tyranny over the ruins of the old; the agony of independent Mexico, struggling with the weight of its overwhelming past and tremendous potential. <\/p> <p>Throughout the narrative the author resurrects the great personalities of Mexican history, such as Motecuhzoma, Cortes, Santa Anna, Juárez, Maximilian, Diaz, Pancho Villa, and Zapata. Fehrenbach, who has updated this edition to include recent events, has created a work of scholarly perspective and gripping prose.<\/p>",

In each locale, Rodney found himself a lightning rod for working class Black Power. His deportation catalyzed 20th-century Jamaica's most significant rebellion, the 1968 Rodney riots, and his scholarship trained a generation how to think politics at an international scale. In 1980, shortly after founding of the Working People's Alliance in Guyana, the 38-year-old Rodney would be assassinated.<\/p> <p>In his magnum opus, <i>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa<\/i>, Rodney incisively argues that grasping \"the great divergence\" between the West and the rest can only be explained as the exploitation of the latter by the former. This meticulously researched analysis of the abiding repercussions of European colonialism on the continent of Africa has not only informed decades of scholarship and activism, it remains an indispensable study for grasping global inequality today.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>This is a riveting and disturbing account of the medical atrocities performed in China during WWII. <\/b><\/p> <p>Some of the cruelest deeds of Japan's war in Asia did not occur on the battlefield, but in quiet, antiseptic medical wards in obscure parts of China. Far from front lines and prying eyes, Japanese doctors and their assistants subjected human guinea pigs to gruesome medical experiments in the name of science and Japan's wartime chemical and biological warfare research. <\/p> <p>Author Hal Gold draws upon a wealth of sources to construct a portrait of the Imperial Japanese Army's most notorious medical unit, giving an overview of its history and detailing its most shocking activities. The book presents the words of former unit members themselves, taken from remarks they made at a traveling Unit 731 exhibition held in Japan in 1994-95. They recount vivid first-hand memories of what it was like to take part in horrific experiments on men, women, and children, their motivations and reasons why they chose to speak about their actions all these years later. <\/p> <p>By showing how the ethics of normal men and women, and even an entire profession, can be warped by the fire of war, this important book offers a window on a time of human madness and the hope that history will not be repeated.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>One of the least understood countries in the world, North Korea has long been known for its repressive regime. Yet it is far from being an impenetrable black box. Media flows covertly into the country, and fault lines are appearing in the government's sealed informational borders. Drawing on deeply personal interviews with North Korean defectors from all walks of life, ranging from propaganda artists to diplomats, Jieun Baek tells the story of North Korea's information underground - the network of citizens who take extraordinary risks by circulating illicit content such as foreign films, television shows, soap operas, books, and encyclopedias. By fostering an awareness of life outside North Korea and enhancing cultural knowledge, the materials these citizens disseminate are affecting the social and political consciousness of a people as well as their everyday lives. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>By the late 1960s and early 1970s, reeling from a wave of urban uprisings, politicians finally worked to end the practice of redlining. Reasoning that the turbulence could be calmed by turning Black city-dwellers into homeowners, they passed the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, and set about establishing policies to induce mortgage lenders and the real estate industry to treat Black homebuyers equally. The disaster that ensued revealed that racist exclusion had not been eradicated, but rather transmuted into a new phenomenon of predatory inclusion.<\/p> <p><i>Race for Profit <\/i>uncovers how exploitative real estate practices continued well after housing discrimination was banned. The same racist structures and individuals remained intact after redlining's end, and close relationships between regulators and the industry created incentives to ignore improprieties. Meanwhile, new policies meant to encourage low-income homeownership created new methods to exploit Black homeowners.<\/p> <p>Narrating the story of a sea-change in housing policy and its dire impact on African Americans, <i>Race for Profit<\/i> reveals how the urban core was transformed into a new frontier of cynical extraction.<\/p>",

Paul Coates was a community worker at the time and didn\u2019t know Eddie well, and the little he knew, he didn\u2019t much like. But Paul was dead certain that Eddie\u2019s charges were bogus. He vowed never to leave Eddie - and in so doing, changed the course of both their lives. <\/p> <p>For more than 43 years, as he raised a family and started a business, Paul visited Eddie in prison, often taking his kids with him. He and Eddie shared their lives and worked together on dozens of legal campaigns in hopes of gaining Eddie\u2019s release. Paul\u2019s founding of the Black Classic Press in 1978 was originally a way to get books to Eddie in prison. When, in 2014, Eddie finally walked out onto the streets of Baltimore, Paul Coates was there to greet him. Today, these two men remain rock-solid comrades and friends, each being the other\u2019s chosen brother. <\/p> <p>When Eddie and Paul met in the Baltimore Panther Party, they were in their early 20s. They are now into their 70s. This book is a record of their lives and their relationship, told in their own voices.

  "summary": "<p>In this groundbreaking history of the modern American metropolis, Richard Rothstein, a leading authority on housing policy, explodes the myth that America's cities came to be racially divided through de facto segregation - that is, through individual prejudices, income differences, or the actions of private institutions like banks and real estate agencies. Rather, <i>The Color of Law<\/i> incontrovertibly makes clear that it was de jure segregation - the laws and policy decisions passed by local, state, and federal governments - that actually promoted the discriminatory patterns that continue to this day. <\/p> <p>Through extraordinary revelations and extensive research that Ta-Nehisi Coates has lauded as \"brilliant\" (<i>The Atlantic<\/i>), Rothstein comes to chronicle nothing less than an untold story that begins in the 1920s, showing how this process of de jure segregation began with explicit racial zoning, as millions of African Americans moved in a great historical migration from the south to the north. <\/p> <p>As Jane Jacobs established in her classic <i>The Death and Life of Great American Cities<\/i>, it was the deeply flawed urban planning of the 1950s that created many of the impoverished neighborhoods we know. Now, Rothstein expands our understanding of this history, showing how government policies led to the creation of officially segregated public housing and the demolition of previously integrated neighborhoods. While urban areas rapidly deteriorated, the great American suburbanization of the post-World War II years was spurred on by federal subsidies for builders on the condition that no homes be sold to African Americans. Finally, Rothstein shows how police and prosecutors brutally upheld these standards by supporting violent resistance to Black families in White neighborhoods. <\/p> <p>The Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited future discrimination but did nothing to reverse residential patterns that had become deeply embedded. Yet recent outbursts of violence in cities like Baltimore, Ferguson, and Minneapolis show us precisely how the legacy of these earlier eras contributes to persistent racial unrest. Rothstein's invaluable examination shows that only by relearning this history can we finally pave the way for the nation to remedy its unconstitutional past. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>When the Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1863, the black community owned less than one percent of the United States' total wealth. More than 150 years later, that number has barely budged. <i>The Color of Money<\/i> pursues the persistence of this racial wealth gap by focusing on the generators of wealth in the black community: black banks. <\/p> <p>The catch-22 of black banking is that the very institutions needed to help communities escape the deep poverty caused by discrimination and segregation inevitably became victims of that same poverty. Not only could black banks not \"control the black dollar\" due to the dynamics of bank depositing and lending but they drained black capital into white banks, leaving the black economy with the scraps. <\/p> <p>Mehrsa Baradaran challenges the long-standing notion that black banking and community self-help is the solution to the racial wealth gap. These initiatives have functioned as a potent political decoy to avoid more fundamental reforms and racial redress. Examining the fruits of past policies and the operation of banking in a segregated economy, she makes clear that only bolder, more realistic views of banking's relation to black communities will end the cycle of poverty and promote black wealth. <\/p>",

Pizarro and his men soon clashed with Atahualpa and a huge force of Inca warriors at the Battle of Cajamarca. Despite being outnumbered by more than 200 to one, the Spaniards prevailed - due largely to their horses, their steel armor and swords, and their tactic of surprise. They captured and imprisoned Atahualpa. Although the Inca emperor paid an enormous ransom in gold, the Spaniards executed him anyway. The following year, the Spaniards seized the Inca capital of Cuzco, completing their conquest of the largest native empire the New World has ever known. Peru was now a Spanish colony, and the conquistadors were wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. <p> But the Incas did not submit willingly. A young Inca emperor, the brother of Atahualpa, soon led a massive rebellion against the Spaniards, inflicting heavy casualties and nearly wiping out the conquerors. Eventually, however, Pizarro and his men forced the emperor to abandon the Andes and flee to the Amazon. There, he established a hidden capital, called Vilcabamba. Although the Incas fought a deadly, 36-year-long guerrilla war, the Spanish ultimately captured the last Inca emperor and vanquished the native resistance.<\/p> <p> Kim MacQuarrie lived in Peru for five years and became fascinated by the Incas and the history of the Spanish conquest. Drawing on both native and Spanish chronicles, he vividly describes the dramatic story of the conquest, with all its savagery and suspense.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>The <i>New York Times<\/i> best seller, updated and expanded, featuring 15 explosive new chapters. <\/p> <p>The previous edition of this now-classic book revealed the existence and subversive manipulations of \"economic hit men\". John Perkins wrote that economic hit men (EHM) \"are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. Their tools include fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex, and murder\". In Perkins' case, the tool was debt - convincing strategically important countries to borrow huge amounts of money for enormous \"development\" projects that served the very rich while driving the country deeper into poverty and debt. And once indebted, these countries could be controlled. <\/p> <p>In this latest edition, Perkins provides revealing new details about how he and others did their work. But, more importantly, in an explosive new section, he describes how the EHM tools are being used around the world more widely than ever - even in the United States. The cancer has metastasized, yet most people still aren't aware of it. <\/p> <p>Fear and debt drive the EHM system. We are hammered with messages that terrify us into believing that we must pay any price, assume any debt, to stop the enemies who, we are told, lurk at our doorsteps. The EHM system - employing false economics, bribes, surveillance, deception, debt, coups, assassinations, and unbridled military power - has become the dominant system of economics, government, and society today. It has created what Perkins calls a \"death economy\". But Perkins offers hope: He concludes with dozens of specific, concrete suggestions for actions all of us can take to wrest control of our world away from the economic hit men and help give birth to a life economy. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Everyone knows that the United States of America is made up of 50 states and, uh...some other stuff. The territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands are often neglected, but they are filled with American flags and national parks and US post offices and some four million people, many of whom are as proudly red-white-and-blue as any Daughter of the American Revolution. In <i>The Not-Quite States of America<\/i>, Doug Mack ventures 31,000 miles across the globe and deep into American history to reveal the fascinating and forgotten story of how these places became part of the United States, what they're like today, and how they helped create the nation as we know it. Along the way Mack meets members of millennia-old indigenous groups, far-flung US government workers, ardent separatists, and tropical-paradise dropouts and dreamers in a quixotic and winning quest to find America where it is least expected. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Against the backdrop of America's escalating urban rebellions in the 1960s, an unexpected cohort of New York radicals unleashed a series of urban guerrilla actions against the city's racist policies and contempt for the poor. Their dramatic flair, uncompromising vision, and skillful ability to link local problems to international crises riveted the media, alarmed New York's political class, and challenged nationwide perceptions of civil rights and black power protest. The group called itself the Young Lords.<\/p> <p>Utilizing oral histories, archival records, and an enormous cache of police records released only after a decade-long Freedom of Information Law request and subsequent court battle, Johanna Fernández has crafted the definitive account of the Young Lords. Led predominantly by poor and working-class Puerto Rican youth, and consciously fashioned after the Black Panther Party, the Young Lords confronted race and class inequality and questioned American foreign policy. Their imaginative, irreverent protests and media conscious tactics won significant reforms and exposed US mainland audiences to the country's quiet imperial project in Puerto Rico. In riveting style, Fernández demonstrates how the Young Lords redefined the character of protest, the color of politics, and the cadence of popular urban culture in the age of great dreams.<\/p>",

Why? The answer lies in the very nature of modern federal criminal laws, which have exploded in number but also become impossibly broad and vague. <\/p> <p>In <i>Three Felonies a Day<\/i>, Harvey A. Silverglate reveals how federal criminal laws have become dangerously disconnected from the English common law tradition and how prosecutors can pin arguable federal crimes on any one of us, for even the most seemingly innocuous behavior. The volume of federal crimes in recent decades has increased well beyond the statute books and into the morass of the Code of Federal Regulations, handing federal prosecutors an additional trove of vague and exceedingly complex and technical prohibitions to stick on their hapless targets. The dangers spelled out in <i>Three Felonies a Day<\/i> do not apply solely to \"white collar criminals,\" state and local politicians, and professionals. No social class or profession is safe from this troubling form of social control by the executive branch, and nothing less than the integrity of our constitutional democracy hangs in the balance.<\/p>",

Rather, it is a series of linked personal essays that will lead general listeners and scientists alike to an understanding of how mosses live and how their lives are intertwined with the lives of countless other beings, from salmon and hummingbirds to redwoods and rednecks. Kimmerer clearly and artfully explains the biology of mosses, while at the same time reflecting on what these fascinating organisms have to teach us.  <\/p> <p>Drawing on her diverse experiences as a scientist, mother, teacher, and writer of Native American heritage, Kimmerer explains the stories of mosses in scientific terms as well as in the framework of indigenous ways of knowing. In her audiobook, the natural history and cultural relationships of mosses become a powerful metaphor for ways of living in the world.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>More than a decade ago, the historian Tony Judt considered whether the behavior of Israel was becoming not only \"bad for Israel itself\" but also, on a wider scale, \"bad for the Jews.\" Under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, this issue has grown ever more urgent. In <i>The State of Israel vs. the Jews<\/i>, veteran journalist Sylvain Cypel addresses it in depth, exploring Israel's rightward shift on the international scene and with regard to the diaspora.<\/p> <p>Cypel reviews the little-known details of the military occupation of Palestinian territory, the mindset of ethnic superiority that reigns throughout an Israeli \"colonial camp\" that is largely in the majority, and the adoption of new laws, the most serious of which establishes two-tier citizenship between Jews and non-Jews. He shows how Israel has aligned itself with authoritarian regimes and adopted the practices of a security state, including the use of technologies such as the software that enabled the tracking and, ultimately, the assassination of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Lastly, <i>The State of Israel vs. the Jews<\/i> examines the impact of Israel's evolution in recent years on the two main communities of the Jewish diaspora, in France and the United States, considering how and why public figures in each differ in their approaches.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>A different kind of politics for a new kind of society - beyond work, scarcity, and capitalism.<\/p> <p>In the 21st century, new technologies should liberate us from work. Automation, rather than undermining an economy built on full employment, is instead the path to a world of liberty, luxury, and happiness - for everyone. Technological advance will reduce the value of commodities - food, health care, and housing - toward zero.<\/p> <p>Improvements in renewable energies will make fossil fuels a thing of the past. Asteroids will be mined for essential minerals. Genetic editing and synthetic biology will prolong life, virtually eliminate disease, and provide meat without animals. New horizons beckon.<\/p> <p>In <i>Fully Automated Luxury Communism<\/i>, Aaron Bastani conjures a vision of extraordinary hope, showing how we move to energy abundance, feed a world of nine billion, overcome work, transcend the limits of biology, and establish meaningful freedom for everyone. Rather than a final destination, such a society merely heralds the real beginning of history.<\/p>",

She ascended the throne in January of 1891, upon the death of her brother, King David Kalakaua. For years after her overthrow, the Queen sought redress in the Congress and courts of the United States, but her efforts failed. Her autobiographical history <i>Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen<\/i> is the only work by a Hawaiian monarch and provides insight into her fight to regain her throne and life on Hawaii during the late-19th century.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Nazism triumphed in Germany during the high era of Jim Crow laws in the United States. Did the American regime of racial oppression in any way inspire the Nazis? <\/p> <p>The unsettling answer is yes. In <i>Hitler's American Model<\/i>, James Whitman presents a detailed investigation of the American impact on the notorious Nuremberg Laws, the centerpiece anti-Jewish legislation of the Nazi regime. Contrary to those who have insisted that there was no meaningful connection between American and German racial repression, Whitman demonstrates that the Nazis took a real, sustained, significant, and revealing interest in American race policies. As Whitman shows, the Nuremberg Laws were crafted in an atmosphere of considerable attention to the precedents American race laws had to offer. German praise for American practices, already found in Hitler's <i>Mein Kampf<\/i>, was continuous throughout the early 1930s, and the most radical Nazi lawyers were eager advocates of the use of American models. <\/p> <p>But while Jim Crow segregation was one aspect of American law that appealed to Nazi radicals, it was not the most consequential one. Rather, both American citizenship and antimiscegenation laws proved directly relevant to the two principal Nuremberg Laws - the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law. Whitman looks at the ultimate, ugly irony that when Nazis rejected American practices, it was sometimes not because they found them too enlightened but too harsh. Indelibly linking American race laws to the shaping of Nazi policies in Germany, <i>Hitler's American Model<\/i> upends understandings of America's influence on racist practices in the wider world.<\/p>",

Opening with a letter from James Baldwin to Davis, and including contributions from numerous radicals such as Black Panthers George Jackson, Huey P.

The scathing analysis of the role of prison and the policing of Black populations offered by Davis and her comrades in this astonishing volume remains as pertinent today as the day it was first published.<\/p> <p>Featuring contributions from George Jackson, Bettina Aptheker, Bobby Seale, James Baldwin, Ruchell Magee, Julian Bond, Huey P.

Jones is buried in London's Highgate Cemetery, to the left of Karl Marx - a location that Boyce Davies finds fitting given how Jones expanded Marxism-Leninism to incorporate gender and race in her political critique and activism.<\/p> <p>Claudia Cumberbatch Jones was born in Trinidad. In 1924, she moved to New York, where she lived for the next 30 years. She was active in the Communist Party from her early 20s onward. A talented writer and speaker, she traveled throughout the United States lecturing and organizing. In the early 1950s, she wrote a well-known column, \"Half the World\", for the <i>Daily Worker<\/i>. As the US government intensified its efforts to prosecute communists, Jones was arrested several times. She served nearly a year in a US prison before being deported and given asylum by Great Britain in 1955.<\/p> <p>Looking at the contents of the FBI file on Jones, Boyce Davies contrasts Jones' own narration of her life with the federal government's. <i>Left of Karl Marx<\/i> establishes Jones as a significant figure within Caribbean intellectual traditions, Black US feminism, and the history of communism.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>\"The dose makes the poison,\" says an old adage, reminding us that all substances have the potential to heal or to harm, depending on their use. This is especially true of tobacco. Although Western medicine treats it as a harmful, addictive drug, tobacco is considered medicinal by indigenous people of the Amazon rain forest. Along with the hallucinogen ayahuasca, tobacco forms a part of treatments designed to heal the body, stimulate the mind, and inspire the soul with visions. <\/p> <p>Anthropologist Jeremy Narby first learned of the shamanic uses of ayahuasca and tobacco while conducting fieldwork in the Amazon region decades ago. After witnessing the transformative power of these mind-altering plants, Narby embarked on a quest to understand their effects on human consciousness. His search led him to contact Rafael Chanchari Pizuri, a traditional healer from the Peruvian Amazon. <\/p> <p>In <i>Plant Teachers<\/i>, Narby and Pizuri hold a cross-cultural dialogue that explores the similarities between ayahuasca and tobacco, the role of these plants in indigenous cultures, and the hidden truths they reveal about nature. Juxtaposing two distinct worldviews, <i>Plant Teachers<\/i> invites listeners on a wide-ranging journey through anthropology, botany, and biochemistry, while raising tantalizing questions about the relationship between science and other ways of knowing.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>\"I have sat on a little oil drum, rusty and in the midst of garbage, and some black brothers and I have grounded together.\" (Walter Rodney) <\/p> <p>In his short life, the Guyanese intellectual Walter Rodney emerged as one of the leading thinkers and activists of the anticolonial revolution, leading movements in North America, South America, the African continent, and the Caribbean. In each locale, Rodney found himself a lightning rod for working class Black Power. His deportation catalyzed 20th century Jamaica's most significant rebellion, the 1968 Rodney riots, and his scholarship trained a generation how to think politics at an international scale. In 1980, shortly after founding of the Working People's Alliance in Guyana, the 38-year-old Rodney would be assassinated. <\/p> <p>In this classic work published in the heady days of international Black power, <i>Groundings with My Brothers<\/i> details the global circulation of emancipatory ideas, but also offers first-hand reports of Rodney's mass movement organizing. Introduced and contextualized by leading Caribbean scholar-activists, this updated edition brings Rodney's legacy to a new generation of radicals.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>For more than a century, the city of Atlanta has been associated with Black achievement in education, business, politics, media, and music, earning it the nickname \"the Black Mecca.\" Atlanta's long tradition of Black education dates back to Reconstruction, and produced an elite that flourished in spite of Jim Crow, rose to leadership during the civil rights movement, and then took power in the 1970s by building a coalition between White progressives, business interests, and Black Atlantans. But as Maurice J. Hobson demonstrates, Atlanta's political leadership - from the election of Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's first Black mayor, through the city's hosting of the 1996 Olympic Games - has consistently mishandled the Black poor. Drawn from vivid primary sources and unnerving oral histories of working-class city-dwellers and hip-hop artists from Atlanta's underbelly, Hobson argues that Atlanta's political leadership has governed by bargaining with white business interests to the detriment of ordinary Black Atlantans.<\/p> <p>In telling this history through the prism of the Black New South and Atlanta politics, policy, and pop culture, Hobson portrays a striking schism between the Black political elite and poor city-dwellers, complicating the long-held view of Atlanta as a mecca for Black people.<\/p>",

In so doing, the Chinese leadership is reversing the trends toward greater political and economic opening, as well as the low-profile foreign policy, that had been put in motion by Deng Xiaoping's \"Second Revolution\" 30 years earlier.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Learn the unbelievable true history of the great warrior tribes of Mexico. More than 13 centuries of incredible spellbinding history are detailed in this intriguing study of the rulers and warriors of Mexico. Dozens of these charismatic leaders of nations and armies are brought to life by the deep research and entertaining storytelling of Peter Tsouras. Tsouras introduces the reader to the colossal personalities of the period: Smoking Frog, the Mexican Machiavelli, the Poet Warlord, the Lion of Anahuac, and others... all of them warlords who shaped one of the most significant regions in world history, men who influenced the civilization of half a continent. The warlords of Mexico, for all their fascinating lives and momentous acts, have been largely ignored by writers and historians, but here that disappointing record is put right by a range of detailed biographies that entertain as they inform. Students of the area, historians working in American history, and long-term visitors and tourists to the region will gain a much clearer understanding of the background history of these territories and the men who formed and reformed them.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>An intimate, revisionist portrait of the early years of Fidel Castro, showing how an unlikely young Cuban led his country in revolution and transfixed the world. <\/p> <p>This book will change how you think about Fidel Castro. Until now, biographers have treated Castro's life like prosecutors, scouring his past for evidence to convict a person they don't like or don't understand. This can make for bad history and unsatisfying biography. <i>Young Castro <\/i>challenges listeners to put aside the caricature of a bearded, cigar-munching, anti-American hothead to discover how Castro became the dictator who acted as a thorn in the side of US presidents for nearly half a century. <\/p> <p>The first American historian in a generation to gain access to the Castro archives in Havana, Jonathan Hansen was able to secure cooperation from Castro's family and closest confidants, gaining access to hundreds of never-before-seen letters and interviews. The result is a nuanced and penetrating portrait of a figure who was determined to be a leader - a man at once brilliant, arrogant, bold, vulnerable, and all too human. A man who, having grown up on an island that felt like a colonial cage, was compelled to lead his country to independence.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Karl Marx (1818-1883) - philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, current affairs journalist, and editor - was one of the most influential and revolutionary thinkers of modern history, but he is rarely thought of as a Jewish thinker, and his Jewish background is either overlooked or misrepresented. Here, distinguished scholar Shlomo Avineri argues that Marx's Jewish origins did leave a significant impression on his work. Marx was born in Trier, then part of Prussia, and his family had enjoyed equal rights and emancipation under earlier French control of the area. But then its annexation to Prussia deprived the Jewish population of its equal rights. These developments led to the reluctant conversion of Marx's father, and similar tribulations radicalized many young intellectuals of that time who came from a Jewish background.<\/p> <p>Avineri puts Marx's Jewish background in its proper and balanced perspective, and traces Marx's intellectual development in light of the historical, intellectual, and political contexts in which he lived.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In this disturbing exposé, journalist Paul L. Williams describes a secret alliance forged at the close of World War II by the CIA, the Sicilian and US mafias, and the Vatican to thwart the possibility of a Communist invasion of Europe. Williams presents evidence suggesting the existence, in many European countries, of \"stay-behind\" units consisting of 5,000 to 15,000 military operatives. The initial funding for these guerrilla armies came from bogus British bank notes and the sale of large stocks of SS morphine that had been smuggled out of Germany and Italy. As the Cold War intensified, the units were used not only to ward off possible invaders but also to thwart the rise of left-wing movements in South America and NATO-based countries by terror attacks. <\/p> <p>Williams argues that Operation Gladio soon gave rise to the toppling of governments, wholesale genocide, the formation of death squads, financial scandals on a grand scale, the creation of the mujahideen, an international narcotics network, and, most recently, the ascendancy of Jorge Mario Bergoglio, a Jesuit cleric with strong ties to Operation Condor (an outgrowth of Gladio in Argentina) as Pope Francis I. <\/p>",

But skeptics have long questioned the official story, and new evidence has surfaced that suggests a widespread conspiracy. <\/p> <p>In <i>TWA 800<\/i>, historian Jack Cashill introduces new documents and testimonies that reveal the shocking true chain of events, from the disastrous crash to the high-level decision to create a cover story and the attempts to silence anyone who dared speak the truth. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Renowned Israeli historian Ilan Pappe's groundbreaking book revisits the formation of the State of Israel. Between 1947 and 1949, over 400 Palestinian villages were deliberately destroyed, civilians were massacred, and around a million men, women, and children were expelled from their homes at gunpoint. <\/p> <p>Denied for almost six decades, had it happened today it could only have been called \"ethnic cleansing.\" Decisively debunking the myth that the Palestinian population left of their own accord in the course of this war, Ilan Pappe offers impressive archival evidence to demonstrate that, from its very inception, a central plank in Israel's founding ideology was the forcible removal of the indigenous population. This is an indispensable book for anyone interested in the current crisis in the Middle East. <\/p>",

Their plan was to turn discontented veterans into American \"brown shirts,\" depose F.D.R., and stop the New Deal. They clandestinely asked Medal of Honor recipient and Marine Major General Smedley Darlington Butler to become the first American Caesar. He, though, was a true patriot and revealed the plot to journalists and to Congress. In a time when a sitting President has invoked national security to circumvent constitutional checks and balances, this episode puts the spotlight on attacks upon our democracy and the individual courage needed to repel them.<\/p>",

Odell sees our attention as the most precious - and overdrawn - resource we have. Once we can start paying a new kind of attention, she writes, we can undertake bolder forms of political action, reimagine humankind's role in the environment, and arrive at more meaningful understandings of happiness and progress. <\/p> <p>Far from the simple anti-technology screed, or the back-to-nature meditation we hear so often, <i>How to Do Nothing<\/i> is an action plan for thinking outside of capitalist narratives of efficiency and techno-determinism.

This is the heyday of the pimp, the hard-won pride and glory, small though it may be; the beginnings of pimp before it was dragged in front of the camera, before pimp juice and pimp style. Though it is a tale of his times, it will remain current and true for as long as there is a race bias, as long as there is a street life, as long as there is exploitation.<\/p>",

Work based on these principles, supervised by the Poverty Action Lab, is being carried out in dozens of countries. Drawing on this and their 15 years of research from Chile to India, Kenya to Indonesia, they have identified wholly new aspects of the behavior of poor people, their needs, and the way that aid or financial investment can affect their lives. Their work defies certain presumptions: that microfinance is a cure-all, that schooling equals learning, that poverty at the level of 99 cents a day is just a more extreme version of the experience any of us have when our income falls uncomfortably low. <\/p> <p>This important book illuminates how the poor live, and offers all of us an opportunity to think of a world beyond poverty.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>\"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.\" (Edward Bernays) <\/p> <p>A seminal and controversial figure in the history of political thought and public relations, Edward Bernays pioneered the scientific technique of shaping and manipulating public opinion, which he famously dubbed the \"engineering of consent\". During World War I, he was an integral part of the US Committee on Public Information, or CPI, a powerful propaganda apparatus that was mobilized to package, advertise, and sell the war to the American people as one that would \"Make the World Safe for Democracy\". The CPI became the blueprint for the marketing strategies of future wars. <\/p> <p>Bernays applied the techniques he had learned in the CPI and, incorporating some of the ideas of Walter Lipmann, became an outspoken proponent of propaganda as a tool for democratic and corporate manipulation of the population. His 1928 bombshell, <i>Propaganda<\/i>, lays out his eerily prescient vision for using propaganda to regiment the collective mind in a variety of areas, including government, politics, art, science, and education. To listen to this book today is to frightfully comprehend what our contemporary institutions of government and business have become in regard to the organized manipulation of the masses. <\/p>",

But if you refine it more closely, the inequality comes from the extreme wealth in a tiny sector of the population, a fraction of 1 percent.... Not only is it extremely unjust in itself, inequality has highly negative consequences on the society as a whole because the very fact of inequality has a corrosive, harmful effect on democracy.\"<br />(Noam Chomsky, in <i>Requiem for the American Dream<\/i>) <\/p> <p><i>Requiem for the American Dream<\/i> is not an essay collection but an entire work of some 70,000 words, based on four years of interviews with Chomsky by the editors. Chomsky considers these to be his final, long-form documentary interviews. It is a book that makes Chomsky's breadth and depth accessible and at the same time gives us his most powerful political ideas with unprecedented, breathtaking directness. It will go down as one of his greatest and most lasting contributions. <\/p> <p><i>Requiem for the American Dream<\/i> is being produced in tandem with the film of the same name that was recently released in selected theaters to rave reviews and standing ovations. It will be on Netflix and touring colleges prior to the book's release. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Recent years have seen an explosion of protest against police brutality and repression. Among activists, journalists, and politicians, the conversation about how to respond and improve policing has focused on accountability, diversity, training, and community relations. Unfortunately, these reforms will not produce results, either alone or in combination. The core of the problem must be addressed: the nature of modern policing itself.  <\/p> <p>This audiobook attempts to spark public discussion by revealing the tainted origins of modern policing as a tool of social control. It shows how the expansion of police authority is inconsistent with community empowerment, social justice - even public safety. Drawing on groundbreaking research from across the world, and covering virtually every area in the increasingly broad range of police work, Alex Vitale demonstrates how law enforcement has come to exacerbate the very problems it is supposed to solve.  <\/p> <p>In contrast, there are places where the robust implementation of policing alternatives - such as legalization, restorative justice, and harm reduction - has led to a decrease in crime, spending, and injustice. The best solution to bad policing may be an end to policing.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Richard Belzer and David Wayne are back to set the record straight after <i>Dead Wrong<\/i>; this time they're going to uncover the truth about the many witness deaths tied to the JFK assassination. <\/p> <p>For decades, government pundits have dismissed these \"coincidental\" deaths, even regarding them as \"myths\" as \"urban legends.\" Like most people, Richard and David were initially unsure about what to make of these 'coincidences'. After all, events don't \"consult the odds\" prior to happening; they simply happen. Then someone comes along later and figures out what the odds of it happening were. Some of the deaths seemed purely coincidental; heart attacks, hunting accidents. Others clearly seemed noteworthy; witnesses who did seem to know something and did seem to die mysteriously. <\/p> <p><i>Hit List<\/i> is a fair examination of the evidence of each case, leading to (necessarily) different conclusions. The findings were absolutely staggering; as some cases were clearly linked to a \"clean-up operation\" after the murder of President Kennedy, while others were the result of 'other forces'. The impeccable research and writing of Richard Belzer and David Wayne show that if the government is trying to hide anything, they're the duo who will uncover it.<\/p>",

In the end, President Johnson would use power from his personal connections in Texas and from the underworld and from the government to escape an untimely end in politics and to seize even greater power. President Johnson, the thirty-sixth president of the United States, was the driving force behind a conspiracy to murder President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. In <i>The Man Who Killed Kennedy<\/i>, you will find out how and why he did it. Political consultant, strategist, and Libertarian Roger Stone has gathered documents and used his firsthand knowledge to construct the ultimate tome to prove that LBJ was not only involved in JFK's assassination, but was in fact the mastermind. With 2013 being the fiftieth anniversary of JFK's assassination, this is the perfect time for <i>The Man Who Killed Kennedy<\/i> to be available to readers.

Horrified by the specter of nuclear annihilation, Kennedy gradually turned away from his long-held Cold Warrior beliefs and toward a policy of lasting peace. But to the military and intelligence agencies in the United States, who were committed to winning the Cold War at any cost, Kennedy's change of heart was a direct threat to their power and influence. Once these dark \"Unspeakable\" forces recognized that Kennedy's interests were in direct opposition to their own, they tagged him as a dangerous traitor, plotted his assassination, and orchestrated the subsequent cover-up. <\/p> <p>Douglass takes listeners into the Oval Office during the tense days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, along on the strange journey of Lee Harvey Oswald and his shadowy handlers, and to the winding road in Dallas where an ambush awaited the president's motorcade. As Douglass convincingly documents, at every step along the way, these forces of the Unspeakable were present, moving people like pawns on a chessboard to promote a dangerous and deadly agenda.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>The last word on the JFK assassination by the <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author and JFK historian! <\/p> <p>Mark Lane tried the only US court case in which the jurors concluded that the CIA plotted the murder of President Kennedy, but there was always a missing piece: How did the CIA control cops and Secret Service agents on the ground in Dealey Plaza? How did federal authorities prevent the House Select Committee on Assassinations from discovering the truth about the complicity of the CIA? <\/p> <p>Now, Mark Lane tells all in this explosive new book, with exclusive new interviews, sworn testimony, and meticulous new research (including interviews with Oliver Stone, Dallas Police deputy sheriffs, Robert K. Tanenbaum, and Abraham Bolden). Lane finds out first hand exactly what went on the day JFK was assassinated. He includes sworn statements given to the Warren Commission by a police officer who confronted a man who he thought was the assassin. The officer testified that he drew his gun and pointed it at the suspect, who showed Secret Service ID. Yet, the Secret Service later reported that there were no Secret Service agents on foot in Dealey Plaza. <\/p> <p><i>The Last Word<\/i> proves that the CIA, operating through a secret small group, prepared all credentials for Secret Service agents in Dallas for the two days that Kennedy was going to be there - conclusive evidence of the CIA's involvement in the assassination.<\/p>",

  "summary": "With new research and previously unavailable interviews, <i>The Last Campaign<\/i> provides an intimate and absorbing historical narrative that goes right to the heart of America's deepest despairs - and most fiercely held dreams - and tells us more than we had understood before about this complicated man and the heightened dramas of his times. <p>After John F. Kennedy's assassination, Robert Kennedy - formerly Jack's no-holds-barred political warrior - almost lost hope. He was haunted by his brother's murder, and by the nation's seeming inabilities to solve its problems of race, poverty, and the war in Vietnam. Bobby sensed the country's pain, and when he announced that he was running for president, the country united behind his hopes. Over the action-packed 82 days of his campaign, Americans were inspired by Kennedy's promise to lead them toward a better time. And after an assassin's bullet stopped this last great stirring public figure of the 1960s, crowds lined up along the country's railroad tracks to say goodbye to Bobby.<\/p> <p>Clarke's <i>The Last Campaign<\/i> is the definitive account of Robert Kennedy's exhilarating and tragic 1968 campaign for president - and a revelatory history that is especially resonant now.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><i>The Missing JFK Assassination Film<\/i> is not the typical JFK assassination book. This book does not attempt to answer the question of who killed John F. Kennedy; instead it addresses why we should question the actions of those involved and why the truth was withheld from the people. Though copies of Orville Nix's film exist, the original film is missing. Why? The FBI confiscated Orville's camera for several months, then returned it in pieces. Were these actions sinister, or were they just examples of governmental incompetence? <\/p><p><i>The Missing JFK Assassination Film<\/i> exposes information about the House Select Committee staff's involvement in the missing film. Author Gayle Nix Jackson's interviews with people who were close to Orville and the film will shed light on the government's involvement with the filmmaker. <\/p><p>Gayle Nix Jackson is the granddaughter of Orville Nix. As his eldest granddaughter, Nix Jackson shares experiences growing up with her beloved grandfather and how his views changed after that fatal day. Hearing his story precipitated the quest Jackson is still on to find the film. Her grandfather was there that day for a reason, and if the original Nix film could be located, modern-day technology could determine if there was indeed another person behind the stockade fence or not. Questions still abound today as to whether or not the film was altered. Finding the original Nix film would answer one of the most enduring questions related to this horrific event: Was there a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963? <\/p><p>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for listeners interested in history - books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times<\/i> best seller or a national best seller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home. <\/p>",

Among the cases discussed:<\/p> <ul> <li>The CIA's top-secret program to control human behavior<\/li> <li>Operation Northwoods: the military plan to hijack airplanes and blame it on Cuban terrorists <\/li> <li>The discovery of a secret Afghan archive, information that never left the boardroom<\/li> <li>Potentially deadly healthcare cover-ups, including a dengue fever outbreak <\/li> <\/ul> <p>What the Department of Defense knows about our food supply but is keeping mum Although these documents are now in the public domain, the powers that be would just as soon they stay under wraps.

  "summary": "<p>Working with thousands of previously unreleased documents and drawing on more than one thousand interviews, with many witnesses speaking out for the first time, Joan Mellen revisits the investigation of New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, the only public official to have indicted, in 1969, a suspect in President John F. Kennedy's murder. <\/p> <p>Garrison began by exposing the contradictions in the Warren Report, which concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was an unstable pro-Castro Marxist who acted alone in killing Kennedy. <i>A Farewell to Justice<\/i> reveals that Oswald, no Marxist, was in fact working with both the FBI and the CIA, as well as with US Customs, and that the attempts to sabotage Garrison's investigation reached the highest levels of the US government. Garrison's suspects included CIA-sponsored soldiers of fortune enlisted in assassination attempts against Fidel Castro, an anti-Castro Cuban asset, and a young runner for the conspirators, interviewed here for the first time by the author. <\/p> <p>Building upon Garrison's effort, Mellen uncovers decisive new evidence and clearly establishes the intelligence agencies' roles in both a president's assassination and its cover-up. In this revised edition, to be published in time for the fiftieth anniversary of the president's assassination, the author reveals new sources and recently uncovered documents confirming in greater detail just how involved the CIA was in the events of November 22, 1963. More than one hundred new pages add critical evidence and information into one of the most significant events in human history. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In <i>A Lie Too Big to Fail<\/i>, longtime Kennedy researcher (of both JFK and RFK) Lisa Pease lays out, in meticulous detail, how witnesses with evidence of conspiracy were silenced by the Los Angeles Police Department; how evidence was deliberately altered and, in some instances, destroyed; and how the justice system and the media failed to present the truth of the case to the public. Pease reveals how the trial was essentially a sham, and how the prosecution did not dare to follow where the evidence led.<\/p> <p><i>A Lie Too Big to Fail<\/i> asserts the idea that a government can never investigate itself in a crime of this magnitude. Was the convicted Sirhan Sirhan a willing participant? Or was he a mind-controlled assassin? It has fallen to independent researchers like Pease to lay out the evidence in a clear and concise manner, allowing listeners to form their theories about this event. Pease places the history of this event in the context of the era and provides shocking overlaps between other high-profile murders and attempted murders of the time. Lisa Pease goes further than anyone else in proving who likely planned the assassination, who the assassination team members were, and why Kennedy was deemed such a threat that he had to be taken out before he became President of the United States.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Chris Harman describes the shape and course of human history as a narrative of ordinary people forming and re-forming complex societies in pursuit of common human goals. Interacting with the forces of technological change as well as the impact of powerful individuals and revolutionary ideas, these societies have engendered events familiar to every schoolchild - from the empires of antiquity to the world wars of the 20th century. <\/p> <p>In a bravura conclusion, Chris Harman exposes the reductive complacency of contemporary capitalism, and asks, in a world riven as never before by suffering and inequality, why we imagine that it can - or should - survive much longer. Ambitious, provocative and invigorating, <i>A People's History of the World<\/i> delivers a vital corrective to traditional history, as well as a powerful sense of the deep currents of humanity which surge beneath the froth of government. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>A revealing, courageous, fascinating, and funny account of the author's experiment with microdoses of LSD in an effort to treat a debilitating mood disorder, of her quest to understand a misunderstood drug, and of her search for a really good day. <\/p> <p>When a small vial arrives in her mailbox from \"Lewis Carroll\", Ayelet Waldman is at a low point. Her mood storms have become intolerably severe; she has tried nearly every medication possible; her husband and children are suffering with her. So she opens the vial, places two drops on her tongue, and joins the ranks of an underground but increasingly vocal group of scientists and civilians successfully using therapeutic microdoses of LSD. As Waldman charts her experience over the course of a month - bursts of productivity, sleepless nights, a newfound sense of equanimity - she also explores the history and mythology of LSD, the cutting-edge research into the drug, and the byzantine policies that control it. Drawing on her experience as a federal public defender and as the mother of teenagers and her research into the therapeutic value of psychedelics, Waldman has produced a book that is eye-opening, often hilarious, and utterly enthralling. <\/p>",

But unlike the journeys of his fellow Muslims, the consequences of his own could be deadly. <\/p> <p>In <i>A Sinner in Mecca<\/i>, author and filmmaker Parvez chronicles his pilgrimage as a very openly gay Muslim to Saudi Arabia, where Islam's heart beats...and where being true to himself is punishable by death. Risking his life, Parvez embarks on a Jihad of the self-filming his experience along the way. Already under fire for his documentary <i>A Jihad for Love<\/i>, which looks at the coexistence of Islam and homosexuality, he would undoubtedly face savage punishment if exposed - from being thrown off a cliff to public beheading. <\/p> <p>Parvez's odyssey is at once audacious, global, and remarkable. He meets everyone from extremists to explorers of the spiritual kind, and the world they open up is frightening...yet breathtaking. In Mecca, Parvez comes out to a pilgrim, who then asks him why he would want to be part of something that wants no part of him. This book is his answer to this question and many more. <\/p>",

I can withstand challenge from without and from within. Am I right, Comrade?\u201d It was August 1974. From a small Oakland-based cell, the Panthers had grown to become a revolutionary national organization, mobilizing Black communities and white supporters across the country - but relentlessly targeted by the police and the FBI, and increasingly riven by violence and strife within. How Brown came to a position of power over this paramilitary, male-dominated organization, and what she did with that power, is a riveting, unsparing account of self-discovery.<\/p> <p>Brown\u2019s story begins with growing up in an impoverished neighborhood in Philadelphia and attending a predominantly white school, where she first sensed what it meant to be Black, female, and poor in America. She describes her political awakening during the bohemian years of her adolescence, and her time as a foot soldier for the Panthers, who seemed to hold the promise of redemption. And she tells of her ascent into the upper echelons of Panther leadership: her tumultuous relationship with the charismatic Huey Newton, who would become her lover and her nemesis; her experience with the male power rituals that would sow the seeds of the party's demise; and the scars that she both suffered and inflicted in that era\u2019s paradigm-shifting clashes of sex and power.

  "summary": "Paul Kagame grew up as a wretched refugee. He and a group of comrades, determined to force their way back home after a generation of exile, designed one of the most audacious covert operations in the history of clandestine war. Then, after taking power, they amazed the world by stabilizing and reviving their devastated country. <p>Now, as President Kagame, he's obsessed with a single outlandish dream: to make Rwanda the first middle-income country in Africa, and to do it in the space of a single generation. <\/p> <p><i>A Thousand Hills<\/i> tells Kagame's tumultuous life story, including his early fascination with Che Guevara and James Bond, his years as an intelligence agent, his training in Cuba and the United States, the dazzlingly original way he built his secret rebel army, his bloody rebellion, and his outsized ambitions for Rwanda. It is the adventure-filled tale of a visionary who won a war, stopped a genocide, and then set out to turn his country into the star of Africa. Like Ishmael Beah's best-selling <i>A Long Way Gone<\/i> and Greg Mortenson's <i>Three Cups of Tea<\/i>, this book recounts the thrilling and uplifting tale of a man who defied the odds to lift himself and his country out of misery toward a more promising future.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In the winter of 1967-68, Robert F. Kennedy, then a US senator from New York, ventured deep into the heart of Appalachia. As acting chairman of a Senate subcommittee on poverty, RFK went to eastern Kentucky to gauge the progress of the War on Poverty. He was deeply disillusioned by what he found. Kennedy learned that job training programs were useless, welfare programs proved insufficient, and jobs were scarce and getting scarcer. Before he'd even left the state, Kennedy had determined the War on Poverty was a failure - and he blamed Lyndon Johnson. <\/p> <p>Robert Kennedy wasn't merely on a fact-finding mission, however; he was considering challenging Johnson for the Democratic presidential nomination, but he needed support from white voters to win it. His trip to eastern Kentucky was an opportunity to test his antiwar and antipoverty message with hardscrabble whites. Kennedy encountered deep resentment in the mountains, and a special disdain for establishment politicians. A month after his visit, RFK officially announced he was challenging Johnson for the Democratic nomination. Four months after his visit, he was murdered. He was 42. <\/p> <p><i>All This Marvelous Potential <\/i>retraces RFK's tour of eastern Kentucky and provides a new portrait of the politician - a politician of uncommon courage who was unafraid to shine a light on our shortcomings.<\/p>",

And according to this former Navy SEAL, former pro wrestler, and former Minnesota governor, the media is complicit in these acts of deception. For too long, the mainstream press has refused to consider alternate possibilities and to ask the tough questions. Here, Ventura looks closely at the theories that have been presented over the years and separates the fact from the fiction. <\/p> <p> In Ventura's eyes, the murder of Abraham Lincoln and the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King all need to be reexamined. Was Watergate presented honestly, or was the CIA involved? Did the Republican Party set out to purposefully steal two elections on behalf of George W. Bush? Has all the evidence been presented about the 9/11 attacks, or is there another angle that the media is afraid to explore? And finally, is the collapse of today's financial order and the bailout plan by the Federal Reserve the widest-reaching conspiracy ever perpetrated?<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b><i>American Exception<\/i><\/b><b> seeks to explain the breakdown of US democracy, in particular to understand the uncanny continuity of American foreign policy, the breakdown of the rule of law, and the extreme concentration of wealth and power into an overworld of the corporate rich.<\/b><\/p> <p>To trace the evolution of the American state, Aaron Good takes a deep-politics approach. The term \u201cdeep state\u201d was badly misappropriated during the Trump era. In the simplest sense, it here refers to all those institutions that collectively exercise undemocratic power over state and society. To trace how we arrived at this point, <i>American Exception<\/i> explores various deep state institutions and history-making interventions.<\/p> <p>Key institutions involve the relationships between the overworld of the corporate rich, the underworld of organized crime, and the national security actors that mediate between them. History-making interventions include the toppling of foreign governments, the launching of aggressive wars, and the political assassinations of the 1960s.<\/p> <p>In its long history before World War II, the United States had a deep political system, a system of governance in which decision-making and enforcement were carried out within\u2014and outside of\u2014public institutions. It was a system that always included some degree of secretive collusion and law-breaking. After World War II, US elites decided to pursue global dominance over the international capitalist system. <\/p> <p>Setting aside the liberal rhetoric, this project was pursued in a manner that was by and large imperialistic rather than progressive. To administer this covert empire, US elites created a massive national security state characterized by unprecedented levels of secrecy and lawlessness. The \u201cGlobal Communist Conspiracy\u201d provided a pretext for <i>exceptionism<\/i>\u2014an endless \u201cexception\u201d to the rule of law.<\/p> <p>What gradually emerged after World War II was a tripartite state system of governance. The open democratic state and the authoritarian security state were both increasingly dominated by an American deep state.<\/p> <p>Aaron Good concludes by assessing the prospects for a revival of US democracy.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>For 400 years - from the first Spanish assaults against the Arawak people of Hispaniola in the 1490s to the US Army's massacre of Sioux Indians at Wounded Knee in the 1890s - the indigenous inhabitants of North and South America endured an unending firestorm of violence. During that time the native population of the Western Hemisphere declined by as many as 100 million people. <\/p> <p>Indeed, as historian David E. Stannard argues in this stunning new book, the European and white American destruction of the native peoples of the Americas was the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world. <\/p> <p>Stannard reveals that wherever Europeans or white Americans went, the native people were caught between imported plagues and barbarous atrocities, typically resulting in the annihilation of 95 percent of their populations. What kind of people, he asks, do such horrendous things to others? His highly provocative answer: Christians. Digging deeply into ancient European and Christian attitudes toward sex, race, and war, he finds the cultural ground well prepared by the end of the Middle Ages for the centuries-long genocide campaign that Europeans and their descendants launched - and in places continue to wage - against the New World's original inhabitants. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Martin Luther King Jr., was a powerful and eloquent champion of the poor and oppressed in the US, and at the height of his fame in the mid-'60s seemed to offer the real possibility of a new and radical beginning for liberal politics in the USA. However, in 1968, he was assassinated; the movement for social and economic change has never recovered. <\/p> <p>The conviction of James Earl Ray for his murder has never looked even remotely safe, and when William Pepper began to investigate the case it was the start of a 25-year campaign for justice. At a civil trial in 1999, supported by the King family, 70 witnesses under oath set out the details of the conspiracy Pepper had unearthed: the jury took just one hour to find that Ray was not responsible for the assassination, that a wide-ranging conspiracy existed, and that government agents were involved. <\/p> <p><i>An Act of State<\/i> lays out the extraordinary facts of the King story - of the huge groundswell of optimism engendered by his charismatic radicalism, of how plans for his execution were laid at the very heart of government and the military, and of the disinformation and media cover-ups that followed every attempt to search out the truth. As shocking as it is tragic, <i>An Act of State<\/i> remains the most compelling and authoritative account of how King's challenge to the US establishment led inexorably to his murder. <\/p>",

Now - with the technological advances of modern archaeology and a new perspective on world history - we are finally able to piece together their compelling true stories. In<i> Ancient Civilizations of North America<\/i>, Professor Edwin Barnhart, Director of the Maya Exploration Center, will open your eyes to a fascinating world you never knew existed - even though you\u2019ve been living right next to it, or even on top of it, for as long as you\u2019ve been on the continent. <\/p> <p>The peoples of ancient North America were exceptionally knowledgeable about their environment, but their intellectual and artistic curiosity went much beyond the immediate need for food and safety. Beginning thousands of years ago, and without benefit of written language, native peoples became mathematicians, construction and soil engineers, astronomers, urban planners, and more. They developed thriving cities, extensive trade routes, canals to bring water to the desert, and earthworks we still marvel over today. <\/p> <p>In 24 exciting lectures, you\u2019ll learn about the vibrant cities of Poverty Point, the first city in North America, built about 3,500 years ago, and Cahokia, the largest city of ancient North America. You\u2019ll explore the many ways in which the Chacoan environment provided cultural and religious focus for peoples of the southwest. And you\u2019ll learn about the Iroquoian source of some of our most basic \u201cAmerican\u201d values. <\/p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b><\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>When we imagine what life might have been like thousands of years in the past, the images we often conjure are primitive ones: reed and mud huts or plain brick dwellings, cooking pits, villagers, and simple farms. That was indeed what life was like in the earliest settlements, but by 5,000 years ago, life in some places had become much more sophisticated than we might think. Impressive achievements - like stepped temples that towered like mountains, elaborate palaces (some with bathrooms and plumbing), and complex houses - were also a part of life for people who lived in cities that arose thousands of years ago, particularly in the fertile region that emerged along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.<\/p> <p>Welcome to Mesopotamia, the ancient name for the region that is now Iraq, a remarkably advanced civilization that flourished for two-thirds of the time that civilization has existed on Earth. Mesopotamians mastered irrigation agriculture; built the first complex urban societies; developed writing, literature, and law; and united vast regions through warfare and diplomacy. While civilizations like Greece and Rome have an unbroken tradition of written histories, the rich history of Mesopotamia has only been recently rediscovered, thanks to the decipherment of Mesopotamia's cuneiform writing less than 200 years ago. In this 24-lecture course taught by Professor Podany, you'll fill in the blanks of your historical understanding as you witness a whole new world opening before your eyes.<\/p> <p>Riveting stories about kings and priestesses as well as ordinary people from all walks of life transport you back in time, giving you invaluable insights into the history of a landmark region that has long been known as the cradle of civilization.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In Oakland, California, in 1966, community college students Bobby Seale and Huey Newton armed themselves, began patrolling the police, and promised to prevent police brutality. Unlike the Civil Rights Movement that called for full citizenship rights for blacks within the US, the Black Panther Party rejected the legitimacy of the US government and positioned itself as part of a global struggle against American imperialism. In the face of intense repression, the Party flourished, becoming the center of a revolutionary movement with powerful allies around the world. <\/p> <p><i>Black Against Empire<\/i> is the first comprehensive overview and analysis of the history and politics of the Black Panther Party. The authors analyze key political questions, such as why so many young black people across the country risked their lives for the revolution, why the Party grew most rapidly during the height of repression, and why allies abandoned the Party at its peak of influence. <\/p> <p>Bold, engrossing, and richly detailed, this book cuts through the mythology and obfuscation, revealing the political dynamics that drove the explosive growth of this revolutionary movement and its disastrous unraveling. <\/p>",

The same year, FBI director J.

O'Neal and his wife fled the United States for Algiers. Eventually they settled in Tanzania, where the O'Neals continue the social justice work of the Panthers through community and agricultural programs and host study-abroad programs for American students.<\/p> <p>Paul Magnarella - O'Neal's attorney during his appeals process from 1997 to 2001-describes his unsuccessful attempts to overturn what he argues was a wrongful conviction. He lucidly reviews the evidence of judicial errors, the prosecution's use of a paid informant as a witness, perjury by both the prosecution's key witness and a federal agent, as well as other constitutional violations. He demonstrates how O'Neal was denied justice during the height of the COINTELPRO assault on black activists in the United States.<\/p>",

Ultimately, Goldsworthy realizes the full complexity of Caesar's character and shows why his political and military leadership continues to resonate some 2,000 years later. In this landmark biography, Goldsworthy examines Caesar as a military leader, as well as his other roles, and places his subject firmly within the context of Roman society in the first century B.C.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>This audiobook contains all 3 volumes of Capital, as well as Marx and Engel's most renowned work, The Communist Manifesto.<\/p> <p>One of the most notorious and influential works of modern times, Capital is an incisive critique of private property and the social relations it generates. It rapidly acquired readership throughout the world when published, to become a work described by Marx's collaborator Friedrich Engels as 'the Bible of the working class'.<\/p> <p>Volume 1: Living in exile in England, where this work was largely written, Marx drew on a wide-ranging knowledge of its society to support his analysis. Arguing that capitalism would cause an ever-increasing division in wealth and welfare, he predicted its abolition and replacement by a system with common ownership of the means of production. Capital rapidly acquired readership throughout the world, to become a work described by Marx's collaborator Friedrich Engels as 'the Bible of the working class'.<\/p> <p>Volume 2: The \"forgotten\" second volume of Capital, Marx's world-shaking analysis of economics, politics, and history. This volume also contains the vital discussion of commodity - the cornerstone to Marx's theories.<\/p> <p>Volume 3: Unfinished at the time of Marx's death in 1883 and first published with a preface by Frederick Engels in 1894, the third volume of Das Kapital strove to combine the theories and concepts of the two previous volumes in order to prove conclusively that capitalism is inherently unworkable as a permanent system for society. Here, Marx asserts that - regardless of the efforts of individual capitalists, public authorities or even generous philanthropists - any market economy is inevitably doomed to endure a series of worsening, explosive crises leading finally to complete collapse. But he also offers an inspirational and compelling prediction: that the end of capitalism will culminate, ultimately, in the birth of a far greater form of society.<\/p> <p>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Slavery helped finance the Industrial Revolution in England. Plantation owners, shipbuilders, and merchants connected with the slave trade accumulated vast fortunes that established banks and heavy industry in Europe and expanded the reach of capitalism worldwide. Eric Williams advanced these powerful ideas in <i>Capitalism and Slavery<\/i>, published in 1944. Years ahead of its time, his profound critique became the foundation for studies of imperialism and economic development. Binding an economic view of history with strong moral argument, Williams's study of the role of slavery in financing the Industrial Revolution refuted traditional ideas of economic and moral progress and firmly established the centrality of the African slave trade in European economic development. He also showed that mature industrial capitalism in turn helped destroy the slave system. Establishing the exploitation of commercial capitalism and its link to racial attitudes, Williams employed a historicist vision that set the tone for future studies.<\/p> <p>William A. Darity, Jr.'s new foreword highlights Williams's insights for a new generation, and Colin Palmer's introduction assesses the lasting impact of Williams's groundbreaking work and analyzes the heated scholarly debates it generated when it first appeared.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>A journalist's 20-year fascination with the Manson murders leads to shocking new revelations about the FBI's involvement in this riveting reassessment of an infamous case in American history.<\/b><\/p> <p>Over two grim nights in Los Angeles, the young followers of Charles Manson murdered seven people, including the actress Sharon Tate, then eight months pregnant. With no mercy and seemingly no motive, the Manson Family followed their leader's every order - their crimes lit a flame of paranoia across the nation, spelling the end of the 60s. Manson became one of history's most infamous criminals, his name forever attached to an era when charlatans mixed with prodigies, free love was as possible as brainwashing, and utopia - or dystopia - was just an acid trip away.<\/p> <p>Twenty years ago, when journalist Tom O'Neill was reporting a magazine piece about the murders, he worried there was nothing new to say. Then he unearthed shocking evidence of a cover-up behind the \"official\" story, including police carelessness, legal misconduct, and potential surveillance by intelligence agents. When a tense interview with Vincent Bugliosi - prosecutor of the Manson Family, and author of <i>Helter Skelter<\/i> - turned a friendly source into a nemesis, O'Neill knew he was onto something. But every discovery brought more questions:<\/p> <p><\/p> <ul> <li>Who were Manson's real friends in Hollywood, and how far would they go to hide their ties?<\/li> <li>Why didn't law enforcement, including Manson's own parole officer, act on their many chances to stop him?<\/li> <li>And how did Manson-an illiterate ex-con-turn a group of peaceful hippies into remorseless killers?<\/li> <\/ul> <p>O'Neill's quest for the truth led him from reclusive celebrities to seasoned spies, from San Francisco's summer of love to the shadowy sites of the CIA's mind-control experiments, on a trail rife with shady cover-ups and suspicious coincidences. The product of two decades of reporting, hundreds of new interviews, and dozens of never-before-seen documents from the LAPD, the FBI, and the CIA, CHAOS mounts an argument that could be, according to Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Steven Kay, strong enough to overturn the verdicts on the Manson murders. This is a book that overturns our understanding of a pivotal time in American history.<\/p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b><\/p>",

Thus, <i>Chicano Movement for Beginners<\/i> is an important attempt to stave off historical amnesia. It seeks to shed light on the multifaceted civil rights struggle known as \"El Movimiento\" that galvanized the Mexican American community, from laborers to student activists, giving them not only a political voice to combat prejudice and inequality, but also a new sense of cultural awareness and ethnic pride. <\/p> <p>Beyond commemorating the past, <i>Chicano Movement for Beginners<\/i> seeks to reaffirm the goals and spirit of the Chicano Movement for the simple reason that many of the critical issues Mexican American activists first brought to the nation's attention then - educational disadvantage, endemic poverty, political exclusion, and social bias - remain as pervasive as ever almost half a century later.<\/p>",

Activist and researcher Siddharth Kara has traveled deep into cobalt territory to document the testimonies of the people living, working, and dying for cobalt. To uncover the truth about brutal mining practices, Kara investigated militia-controlled mining areas, traced the supply chain of child-mined cobalt from toxic pit to consumer-facing tech giants, and gathered shocking testimonies of people who endure immense suffering and even die mining cobalt.<\/p> <p>Cobalt is an essential component to every lithium-ion rechargeable battery made today, the batteries that power our smartphones, tablets, laptops, and electric vehicles. Roughly 75 percent of the world\u2019s supply of cobalt is mined in the Congo, often by peasants and children in sub-human conditions. Billions of people in the world cannot conduct their daily lives without participating in a human rights and environmental catastrophe in the Congo.

It also provides a road map to avoiding classic temptations, suggesting a series of reforms that would ensure that better people get into power, while ensuring that power purifies rather than corrupts.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In July 1995, <i>San Jose Mercury-News<\/i> reporter Gary Webb found the Big One - the blockbuster story every journalist secretly dreams about - without even looking for it. A simple phone call concerning an unexceptional pending drug trial turned into a massive conspiracy involving the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, L.A. and Bay Area crack cocaine dealers, and the Central Intelligence Agency. For several years during the 1980s, Webb discovered, Contra elements shuttled thousands of tons of cocaine into the United States, with the profits going toward the funding of Contra rebels attempting a counterrevolution in their Nicaraguan homeland. Even more chilling, Webb quickly realized, was that the massive drug-dealing operation had the implicit approval - and occasional outright support - of the CIA, the very organization entrusted to prevent illegal drugs from being brought into the United States. <\/p> <p>Within the this audiobook version of <i>Dark Alliance<\/i>, Webb produces a massive amount of evidence that suggests that such a scenario did take place, and more disturbing evidence that the powers that be that allowed such an alliance are still determined to ruthlessly guard their secrets. Webb's research is impeccable - names, dates, places, and dollar amounts gather and mount with every page, eventually building a towering wall of evidence in support of his theories. <\/p> <p>After the original series of articles ran in the <i>Mercury-News<\/i> in late 1996, both Webb and his paper were so severely criticized by political commentators, government officials, and other members of the press that his own newspaper decided it best not to stand behind the series, in effect apologizing for the assertions and disavowing his work. Webb quit the paper in disgust in November 1997. This audiobook serves as both a complex memoir of the time of the Contras and an indictment of the current state of America's press; <i>Dark Alliance<\/i> is as necessary and valuable as it is horrifying and grim. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>From the three-time Pulitzer Prize winner and author of the <i>New York Times<\/i> best seller <i>Angler<\/i>, the definitive master narrative of Edward Snowden and the modern surveillance state, based on unique access to Snowden and groundbreaking reportage around the world.<\/p> <p>Edward Snowden touched off a global debate in 2013 when he gave Barton Gellman, Laura Poitras, and Glenn Greenwald each a vast and explosive archive of highly classified files revealing the extent of the American government\u2019s access to our every communication. They shared the Pulitzer Prize that year for public service. For Gellman, who never stopped reporting, that was only the beginning.<\/p> <p>He jumped off from what Snowden gave him to track the reach and methodology of the US surveillance state and bring it to light with astonishing new clarity. Along the way, he interrogated Snowden\u2019s own history and found important ways in which myth and reality do not line up. Gellman treats Snowden with respect, but this is no hagiographic account, and <i>Dark Mirror<\/i> sets the record straight in ways that are both fascinating and important.<\/p> <p><i>Dark Mirror<\/i> is the story that Gellman could not tell before, a gripping inside narrative of investigative reporting as it happened and a deep dive into the machinery of the surveillance state. Gellman recounts the puzzles, dilemmas, and tumultuous events behind the scenes of his work - in top secret intelligence facilities, in Moscow hotel rooms, in huddles with <i>Post<\/i> lawyers and editors, in Silicon Valley executive suites, and in encrypted messages from anonymous accounts. Within the book is a compelling portrait of national security journalism under pressure from legal threats, government investigations, and foreign intelligence agencies intent on stealing Gellman\u2019s files. Throughout <i>Dark Mirror<\/i>, Gellman wages an escalating battle against unknown adversaries who force him to mimic their tradecraft in self-defense.<\/p> <p>With the vivid and insightful style that is the author\u2019s trademark, <i>Dark Mirror<\/i> is a true-life spy tale about the surveillance-industrial revolution and its discontents. Along the way, with the benefit of fresh reporting, it tells the full story of a government leak unrivaled in drama since <i>All the President\u2019s Men.<\/i><\/p>",

For more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods - that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. <\/p> <p>Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like \"guilt\", \"sin\", and \"redemption\") derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>En este revolucionario trabajo que ha permanecido por mas de dos anos en la lista de los libros mas vendidos del <i>New York Times<\/i>, Michelle Alexander argumenta que \"no hemos erradicado las castas raciales en Estados Unidos; las hemos meramente redisenado\". Al apuntar a hombres negros por medio de la Guerra contra las Drogas y diezmando las comunidades de gente de color, el sistema de justicia criminal de Estados Unidos funciona como un sistema contemporaneo de control racial - al relegar a millones de personas a un estatus de segunda clase - incluso mientras este se adhiere al principio de ceguera para los colores. Los hispanoamericanos estan ampliamente representados en este sistema de encarcelamiento masivo que Alexander describe: 15 por ciento de todos los latinos en Estados Unidos dicen que ellos o alguien de su familia inmediata ha sido arrestado dentro de los ultimos cinco anos; y que cerca del 25 por ciento de los latinos de entre 18 y 29 anos comparten esta experiencia. Los latinos representan cerca de la mitad de todos los convictos en las prisiones federales, y en California (uno de los pocos estados que cuenta con informacion sobre esto), los latinos componen un 40 por ciento de todos los arrestos. Catedraticos tales como Tom Romero han sugerido que <i>The New Jim Crow<\/i> provee de los fundamentos esenciales para comprender el \"nuevo sistema Jim Crow\" de inmigracion y detencion en los Estados Unidos al dia de hoy. Millones de familias de habla hispana afectadas por este sistema apreciaran contar con una edicion en espanol de este libro que ha sido considerado como \"invaluable\" por el <i>Daily Kos<\/i> y \"explosivo\" por <i>Kirkus Reviews<\/i>. <\/p> <p><b>Please note: This audiobook is in Spanish.<\/b> <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>First published in 1999, the groundbreaking <i>Exile and Pride<\/i> is essential to the history and future of disability politics. Eli Clare's revelatory writing about his experiences as a white disabled genderqueer activist/writer established him as one of the leading writers on the intersections of queerness and disability and permanently changed the landscape of disability politics and queer liberation. <\/p><p>With a poet's devotion to truth and an activist's demand for justice, Clare deftly unspools the multiple histories from which our ever-evolving sense of self unfolds. His essays weave together memoir, history, and political thinking to explore meanings and experiences of home: home as place, community, bodies, identity, and activism. Here listeners will find an intersectional framework for understanding how we actually live with the daily hydraulics of oppression, power, and resistance. At the root of Clare's exploration of environmental destruction and capitalism, sexuality and institutional violence, gender and the body politic, is a call for social justice movements that are truly accessible to everyone. <\/p><p>With heart and hammer, <i>Exile and Pride<\/i> pries open a window onto a world where our whole selves, in all their complexity, can be realized, loved, and embraced. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre said that \"words are loaded pistols\". In the hands of Russ Baker, they are hydrogen bombs. Throughout <i>Family of Secrets<\/i>, he explodes the myths and lies that powerful forces have perpetrated on the American consciousness. He digs beneath the surface in a form of journalistic archeology to reveal the hidden history of one of America's most powerful families, leaving no stone unturned. Moreover, he names all of his sources and documents the materials he relies on to unmask the hypocrisy behind the myth. <\/p> <p>From Prescott Bush's ties to Nazi Germany to Poppy Bush's secret role in the Watergate scandal that ousted Richard Nixon, which was, in fact, a \"silent coup\", to George W. Bush's deceit in launching the war in Iraq, Russ Baker unmasks the truth with a relentless brilliance unmatched by his peers. His publisher, Bloomsbury, is to be congratulated for its confidence in Russ Baker at a time when most publishers are hedging their bets and looking over their shoulders in acts of self-censorship. <\/p> <p>Baker's revelations about George W. Bush's private life is worth the price of the audiobook alone. Here is Bush, forcing himself on a Danish beauty, stripping to the nude, while getting another girlfriend he knocks up an abortion, and then later, as president, opposing abortion and cutting funding for organizations that provide information about birth control. How he managed to get the Danish beauty to go on record, as he does with other key players in Watergate and the Kennedy assassination, is nothing short of astonishing. <\/p> <p>He traces the true history of Poppy Bush's career, from his early ties to the CIA he pretended never existed, while declaring himself \"out of the loop\", to his strange phone call from Dallas to the FBI on the day of Kennedy's assassination, pointing a finger at a suspect who was in fact totally innocent, to his manipulation of Watergate to get rid of Nixon. It's a secret story forced out of the shadows by the powerful documentation of Baker in this tour de force, which will keep you listening in astonishment. <\/p> <p>What he discloses is America's War of the Roses, as powerful families fight to the death for ultimate power. The history of Lee Harvey Osward in the world of wealth, power, and intelligence that was Dallas at the time is amazing. The anodyne courses in political science and history at American colleges and universities need very much to inject <i>Family of Secrets<\/i> into the curriculum so young Americans can be more able to understand what America is truly about. It puts the dots together in a way that makes any further naivety among Americans impossible. What he tells us simply cannot be ignored. <\/p> <p><i>Family of Secrets<\/i> takes to what Cyril Connolly so aptly described as the \"blood crossroads of literature and politics\". After <i>Family of Secrets<\/i>, neither will ever be the same.<\/p>",

What began as an association of convenience would fundamentally shape their political visions, propelling them further than either had dared imagine. Ironically, though, their jointly conceived vision of revolution would ultimately force them to choose between friendship and their beliefs. <\/p><p>At a momentous turning point in Cuban history, Simon Reid-Henry offers a fascinating and original chronicle of two of the most powerful personalities in recent memory. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>A powerful story of war in our time, of love of country, the experience of tragedy, and a platoon at the center of it all.<\/b><\/p> <p>This is a story that starts off close and goes very big. The initial part of the story might sound familiar at first: it is about a platoon of mostly 19-year-old boys sent to Afghanistan, and an experience that ends abruptly in catastrophe. Their part of the story folds into the next: inexorably linked to those soldiers and never comprehensively reported before is the US Department of Defense\u2019s quest to build the world\u2019s most powerful biometrics database, with the ability to identify, monitor, catalog, and police people all over the world.<\/p> <p><i>First Platoon<\/i> is an American saga that illuminates a transformation of society made possible by this new technology. Part war story, part legal drama, it is about identity in the age of identification. About humanity - physical bravery, trauma, PTSD, a yearning to do right and good - in the age of biometrics, which reduce people to iris scans, fingerprint scans, voice patterning, detection by odor, gait, and more. And about the power of point of view in a burgeoning surveillance state.<\/p> <p>Based on hundreds of formerly classified documents, FOIA requests, and exclusive interviews, <i>First Platoon<\/i> is an investigative exposé by a master chronicler of government secrets. <i>First Platoon<\/i> reveals a post-9/11 Pentagon whose identification machines have grown more capable than the humans who must make sense of them. A Pentagon so powerful it can cover up its own internal mistakes in pursuit of endless wars. And a people at its mercy, in its last moments before a fundamental change so complete it might be impossible to take back.<\/p>",

Yet despite decades of appeals, mass street protests, petition campaigns, and peaceful demonstrations, we are still facing a booming fossil fuel industry, rising seas, rising emission levels, and a rising temperature. With the stakes so high, why haven't we moved beyond peaceful protest?<\/p> <p>In this lyrical manifesto, noted climate scholar (and saboteur of SUV tires and coal mines) Andreas Malm makes an impassioned call for the climate movement to escalate its tactics in the face of ecological collapse. We need, he argues, to force fossil fuel extraction to stop--with our actions, with our bodies, and by defusing and destroying its tools. We need, in short, to start blowing up some oil pipelines.<\/p> <p>Offering a counter-history of how mass popular change has occurred, from the democratic revolutions overthrowing dictators to the movement against apartheid and for women's suffrage, Malm argues that the strategic acceptance of property destruction and violence has been the only route for revolutionary change. In a braided narrative that moves from the forests of Germany and the streets of London to the deserts of Iraq, Malm offers us an incisive discussion of the politics and ethics of pacifism and violence, democracy and social change, strategy and tactics, and a movement compelled by both the heart and the mind. Here is how we fight in a world on fire.<\/p> <p>This audio edition of <i>How to Blow Up a Pipeline<\/i> is skillfully narrated by Brian Arens, an Audible listener favorite.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><b>The first-ever edition of Che Guevara's letters, the vast majority never before published in English in any form.<\/b><\/p> <p>Ernesto Che Guevara was a voyager - and thus a letter writer - for his entire adult life. The letters collected in<i> I Embrace You with All My Revolutionary Fervor: Letters 1947-1967<\/i> range from letters home during his <i>Motorcycle Diaries<\/i> trip, to the long letter to Fidel after the success of the Cuban revolution in early 1959 (from which the book's title comes), from the most personal to the intensely political, revealing someone who not only thought deeply about everything he encountered, but for whom the process of social transformation was a constant companion from his youth until shortly before his death. His letters give us Che the son, the friend, the lover, the guerrilla fighter, the political leader, the philosopher, the poet. Che in these letters is often playful, funny, sometimes sarcastic, and deeply affectionate. His life was short, and these 20 years, from when he was 19 until days before his death, show it was also incredibly rich and full.<\/p> <p>As his daughter Aleida Guevara, also a doctor like her father, writes, \"When you write a speech, you pay attention to the language, the punctuation and so on. But in a letter to a friend or a member of your family, you don't worry about those things. It is you speaking, in your authentic voice. That's what I like about these letters; they show who Che really was and how he thought.
